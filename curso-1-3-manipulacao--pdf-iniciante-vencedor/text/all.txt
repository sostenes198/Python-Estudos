Marcus Aurelius Antoninus
States will never be happy until rulers become philosophers or philosophers become
rulers.
—PLATO, The Republic
Marcus Aurelius is said to have been fond of quoting Plato’s
dictum, and those who have written about him have rarely
been able to resist applying it to Marcus himself. And
indeed, if we seek Plato’s philosopher-king in the flesh we
could hardly do better than Marcus, the ruler of the Roman
Empire for almost two decades and author of the immortal
Meditations. Yet the title is one that Marcus himself would
surely have rejected. He never thought of himself as a
philosopher. He would have claimed to be, at best, a diligent
student and a very imperfect practitioner of a philosophy
developed by others. As for the imperial throne, that came
almost by accident. When Marcus Annius Verus was born, in
A.D. 121, bystanders might have predicted a distinguished
career in the Senate or the imperial administration. They
==>> Page 8
could hardly have guessed that he was destined for the
imperial purple, or seen in their mind’s eye the lonely bronze
horseman whose upraised hand greets us from the Capitoline
hill in Rome across two thousand years.
Marcus sprang from a distinguished enough family. The
year of his birth coincided with his grandfather’s second
tenure of the consulship, in theory Rome’s highest office,
though now of largely ceremonial importance. And it was to
be his grandfather who brought him up, for his father died
when he was very young. Marcus makes reference in the
Meditations to his father’s character as he remembered it or
heard of it from others, but his knowledge must have been
more from stories than from actual memories. Of the
remainder of his childhood and his early adolescence we
know little more than can be gleaned from the Meditations.
The biography of him in the so-called Historia Augusta (a
curious and unreliable work of the late fourth century
probably based on a lost series of lives by the third-century
biographer Marius Maximus) tells us that he was a serious
child, but also that he loved boxing, wrestling, running and
falconry, that he was a good ballplayer and that he loved to
hunt. None of these are surprising occupations in an upper-
class youth.
Book 1 of the Meditations offers glimpses of Marcus’s
schooling, and we can fill out the picture by what is known
of upper-class education generally at this period. His first
==>> Page 9
instructors, like the unnamed teacher mentioned in
Meditations 1.5, were probably slaves, from whom he
would have mastered the rudiments of reading and writing.
At a later stage he would have been handed over to private
tutors to be introduced to literature, especially, no doubt,
Vergil’s great epic, the Aeneid. But literature served only as
a preparation for the real goal. This was rhetoric, the key to
an active political career under the empire, as it had been
under the Republic. Under the supervision of a trained rhetor,
Marcus would have begun with short exercises before
progressing to full-scale practice declamations in which he
would have been asked to defend one side or another in
imaginary law cases, or to advise a prominent historical
figure at a turning point in his career. (Should Caesar cross
the Rubicon? Should Alexander turn back at the Indus? Why
or why not?)
Such training was conducted in Greek as well as Latin.
Since at least the beginning of the first century B.C. the
Roman upper classes had been essentially bilingual, and
Marcus’s spoken and written Greek would have been as
fluent as the French of a nineteenth-century Russian aristocrat
or the Chinese of a Heian Japanese courtier. Marcus would
have read Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey and the tragedies of
Euripides side by side with the Aeneid, and studied the
speeches of the great Athenian orator Demosthenes as
intensively as those of the Roman statesman Cicero. It was
Greek writers and artists who constituted the intellectual
==>> Page 10
elite at the capital; when in later life the emperor conversed
with his court physician, Galen, he would have done so in the
latter’s native tongue. Above all, Greek remained
overwhelmingly the language of philosophy. In the late
Republic and early empire, writers like Lucretius, Cicero
and Seneca had worked to create a philosophical literature in
Latin, with notable success. But the great thinkers—Plato,
Aristotle, Theophrastus, Zeno, Chrysippus, Epicurus, etc.—
had all been Greeks. Serious philosophical investigation
required a familiarity with the language they wrote in and the
terminology they developed. That Marcus composed his own
Meditations in Greek is natural enough.
In 137, when Marcus was sixteen, a crucial event took
place. The reigning emperor, Hadrian, was childless. An
illness had brought him near to death a year previously, and
it was clear that he would not live forever. Hadrian owed his
throne to his adoption by his predecessor and distant
relative, Trajan. Following Trajan’s example, Hadrian had
designated the distinguished aristocrat Lucius Ceionius
Commodus to succeed him. In 137, however, Ceionius died
unexpectedly, and Hadrian was forced to cast about for a
new successor. His choice fell on the childless senator
Antoninus, whom he selected with the proviso that Antoninus
should in turn adopt Marcus (his nephew by marriage) along
with Ceionius’s son Lucius Verus, then aged seven. Marcus
took on the family name of his adopted father, becoming
Marcus Aurelius Antoninus.
==>> Page 11
Hadrian’s death the following year left Marcus first in line
for the throne. His education and that of the younger Verus
were now matters of still greater concern, and it is clear that
no expense was spared. For training in Greek rhetoric, he
was entrusted to Herodes Atticus, a fabulously wealthy
Athenian rhetorician whose tempestuous relations with his
family, fellow citizens and the imperial court itself would
have furnished ample material for a soap opera. His
instructor in Latin oratory was Marcus Cornelius Fronto, a
prominent rhetorician from Cirta in North Africa. By an
accident of fate, many of Fronto’s letters to Marcus have
survived, and they illustrate the close relationship between
student and teacher. They also suggest Fronto’s regret at
seeing Marcus move away from rhetoric to delve ever more
deeply into philosophy. The first book of the Meditations
pays tribute to a number of philosophers from whom Marcus
learned, both formally and informally, and he is likely to
have studied with or listened to many others.
Marcus would have learned much outside the classroom as
well. For training in legal and political matters, an informal
apprenticeship bound aristocratic youths to older public
figures—men like Junius Rusticus, whose influence Marcus
chronicles in 1.7. But the single greatest influence was surely
Marcus’s adopted father, Antoninus Pius. Marcus would
have watched as Antoninus received embassies, tried legal
cases and dictated letters to his deputies. Meanwhile
Marcus’s own position as heir apparent was signaled in
==>> Page 12
various ways. In 140 he served as consul (at the age of
nineteen), and would serve again in 145. In the same year he
married Antoninus’s daughter Faustina, to whom he pays
tribute in Meditations 1.17.
Edward Gibbon’s History of the Decline and Fall of the
Roman Empire describes the reign of Antoninus as
“furnishing very few materials for history, which is indeed
little more than the register of the crimes, follies, and
misfortunes of mankind.” It furnishes equally little material
for Marcus’s biography. In the decade and a half between
145 and 161 we learn little of Marcus’s occupations, and our
only glimpses of his inner development come from his
correspondence with Fronto. But the two poles that would
govern the remainder of his life—the court and philosophy—
seem by this point to be fully established. There is no
evidence that Marcus experienced anything like the
“conversion” to philosophy that some ancient figures
experienced (or affected), but it is clear that by the middle to
late 140s philosophy was becoming increasingly central to
his life.
On August 31, 161, Antoninus died, leaving Marcus as his
sole successor. Marcus immediately acted to carry out what
appears to have been Hadrian’s original intention (perhaps
ignored by Antoninus) by pushing through the appointment of
his adopted brother, Lucius Verus, as co-regent. Verus’s
character has suffered by comparison with Marcus’s. Ancient
==>> Page 13
sources, in particular the gossipy Historia Augusta, tend to
paint him as a self-indulgent degenerate—almost another
Nero. This may be unfair; it is certainly not the picture of him
we get from Marcus’s own reminiscences in the
Meditations. It does seem clear, however, that Marcus
functioned as the senior emperor in fact if not name. It would
be surprising if he had not. He was almost a decade older,
and had been trained for the position by Antoninus himself.
What kind of ruler did this philosopher-king prove to be?
Not, perhaps, as different from his predecessors as one might
have expected. Though an emperor was all-powerful in
theory, his ability to control policy was in reality much more
limited. Much of his time was spent fielding problems that
had moved up the administrative ladder: receiving embassies
from the large cities of the empire, trying appeals of criminal
cases, answering queries from provincial governors and
dealing with petitions from individuals. Even with a
functional system of imperial couriers, news could take
weeks to travel from the periphery of the empire to the
center; imperial edicts took time to move down the chain of
command. While the emperor’s decision had the force of
law, enforcement was almost entirely in the hands of
provincial governors, whose diligence might be affected by
incompetence, corruption, or an understandable desire not to
antagonize local elites.
We get occasional glimpses of Marcus’s day-to-day duties
==>> Page 14
from the evidence of imperial decisions preserved in letters,
inscriptions and the legal codes. Surviving legislation shows
a certain interest in the freeing of slaves and in regulations
relating to the guardianship of orphans. Attempts have been
made to tie the first to Marcus’s philosophical convictions
and the second to his own memories of life without a father.
But it remains unclear how much of the policy is due to
Marcus himself, and how far it differs from that of Marcus’s
predecessor, Antoninus. Perhaps more interesting are the
traces of Marcus’s personality to be discerned in the
phrasing of imperial documents, where we find a scrupulous
attention to detail and a self-consciousness about linguistic
usage that seems to differentiate Marcus from his
predecessors. Neither trait surprises in the author of the
Meditations or a student of Fronto, whose extant letters
place great stress on the quest for the mot juste.
One of Marcus’s priorities was to preserve good relations
with the Senate. The goal was to disguise the absoluteness
with which the emperor ruled: to preserve a facade—and
sometimes, no doubt, even to achieve the reality—of
consensus and cooperation. A hundred years before,
aristocrats might have dreamed of a restored Republic (as
some certainly did). But by the second century it was clear
that there was no alternative to the principate. The Senate
expected deference in public and hoped for influence behind
the scenes; “good” emperors were willing to play along. In
cultivating the upper classes Marcus was following in the
==>> Page 15
footsteps of Antoninus and Trajan, rather than of Hadrian,
whose relations with the Senate had been prickly. And it is
this, as much as anything else, that is responsible for his
reputation as a benevolent statesman. An emperor might do
as he liked while he lived, but it was the senatorial historians
—men like Cornelius Tacitus in the 120s or Cassius Dio in
the generation after Marcus’s death—who had the last word.
Another area where Marcus’s policy continued that of his
predecessors related to a small and eccentric sect known as
the Christians. In the course of the next century they would
become 
an 
increasing 
problem 
for 
the 
imperial
administration, and they were prominent enough in Marcus’s
day to attract an extended denunciation from a certain Celsus,
part of whose work “Against the Christians” still survives.
The sect met with contempt from those intellectuals who
deigned to take notice of it (Marcus’s tutor Fronto was
evidently one), and with suspicion and hostility from
ordinary citizens and administrators. The Christians’
disfavor stemmed from their failure to acknowledge the gods
worshipped by the community around them. Their
“atheism”—their refusal to accept any god but their own—
endangered their neighbors as well as themselves, and their
reluctance to acknowledge the divine status of the emperor
threatened the social order and the well-being of the state.
Christianity had been illegal since the early second century
when a query from Pliny the Younger (then governor of
==>> Page 16
Bithynia in Asia Minor) prompted the emperor Trajan to
establish a formal policy: While Christians were not to be
sought out, those who confessed to the faith were to be
executed. But empire-wide persecution did not become a
reality until a much later date. The main threat to Christians
in the second century came from individual provincial
governors, acting either on their own initiative or under
pressure from local communities. In the late 170s, for
example, civic unrest at Lyons resulted in a virtual pogrom of
Greek-speaking Christians resident there. Marcus’s mentor
Junius Rusticus had tried and executed Christians (the
apologist Justin Martyr among them) in his capacity as city
prefect. Marcus himself was no doubt aware of Christianity,
but there is no reason to think that it bulked large in his mind.
The one direct reference to it in the Meditations (11.3) is
almost certainly a later interpolation, and the implicit
references some scholars have discerned are surely illusory.
Marcus, in any case, had more serious concerns than this
troublesome cult. Soon after his accession, relations between
Rome and its only rival, the Parthian empire in the East, took
a dramatic turn for the worse. Since at least the time of
Trajan the two states had been locked in a cold war that
would continue for the next two centuries, and that once a
generation or so flared up into a military conflict. The death
of Antoninus and the accession of two new and untried rulers
may have tempted the Parthian ruler Vologaeses III to test the
waters. In 162 his forces occupied Armenia and wiped out a
==>> Page 17
Roman garrison that had gone to the rescue. Syria itself was
threatened. Rome had no choice but to respond.
It was Verus, the younger emperor, who was sent east,
where he remained for the next four years. Neither he nor
Marcus had any military experience to speak of (Antoninus’s
peaceful reign had given little scope for it), and the day-to-
day conduct of the war was no doubt left to the professionals.
After initial setbacks the Romans rallied and, under such
commanders as the dynamic young Avidius Cassius, forced
the Parthians to sue for peace. Parthia would remain a threat,
but one that could be dealt with by diplomatic means for the
immediate future.
Verus and his senior colleague had no time to bask in their
triumph, however. Within a year the empire was in the grip
of a devastating plague, apparently brought back from the
East by Lucius’s troops. Its effects may not have been quite
as apocalyptic as later writers suggest, but the death toll was
certainly high, and it also delayed the emperors’ response to
a second threat. This was the increasing instability on the
empire’s other border, the northern frontier that separated
Rome from the barbarian peoples of Germany, eastern
Europe and Scandinavia. During this period a number of
these tribes were under pressure from peoples farther north
and reacted by moving across the empire’s borders—not for
conquest, but in search of land to settle. Rome’s reaction
alternated between aggressive resistance and attempts at
==>> Page 18
accommodation; its failure to develop a workable policy
would eventually result in the collapse of the Western empire
some three centuries later.
In some places a line could be drawn. Hadrian’s great
wall, stretching across Britain, was intended to secure the
empire’s most distant frontier; under Antoninus it had been
briefly superseded by a second line farther to the north. But
such fortifications were impracticable on the continent, and it
was there that the threat was concentrated. Rome still
remembered the catastrophe of A.D. 9, when the Roman
general Varus and three legions had marched into the forests
of Germany, never to return. In the second century, the
greatest source of anxiety was the area farther south, roughly
corresponding to modern-day Romania and Hungary.
Trajan’s conquest of Dacia two generations before had
cleared out a possible source of trouble, but the potential for
friction remained. In Marcus’s day three peoples presented a
special problem: the Quadi, the Marcomanni, and the
Jazyges, also called Sarmatians. The removal of three
legions to Parthia had seriously weakened the Roman
position on the northern frontier, and barbarians took
advantage of the situation. In 168, Marcus and Verus
marched north to deal with them.
Much of the remainder of the reign would be spent on
intermittent warfare, first in the so-called Marcomannic
Wars of the early 170s and then in a second campaign later in
==>> Page 19
that decade. And most of the burden was to be borne by
Marcus alone, for Verus died suddenly (apparently of a
stroke) in early 169. It was a very different kind of war than
the traditional campaign Verus’s armies had waged. The
conventional military and diplomatic tactics that worked
against the Parthians were of limited use here. Instead, the
Romans had to negotiate with individual chieftains whose
authority was limited and whose reliability was always in
doubt. When negotiation failed, the only alternative was a
slow and bloody succession of small-scale engagements
rather than pitched battles. The progress of the campaign is
recorded on the column erected in Rome to commemorate the
close of the Marcomannic Wars. In spite of its triumphal
purpose, the engraved scenes that spiral around the
monument paint a grim picture of brutal fighting, devastation
and execution. “Spiders are proud of catching flies,” Marcus
notes mordantly, “men of catching hares, fish in a net, boars,
bears, Sarmatians” (10.10). The gruesome vignette that opens
Meditations 8.34 (“a severed hand or foot, or a decapitated
head”) may well reflect Marcus’s own experience.
By 175 the Romans seemed to have gained the upper hand.
But at this point disturbing news arrived. Avidius Cassius,
who had distinguished himself as a general during the
Parthian War and who as governor of Syria now served as
virtual regent of the Eastern empire, had revolted and
declared himself emperor. Some of the Eastern provinces
(notably Cappadocia) remained loyal to Marcus, but Cassius
==>> Page 20
was recognized as emperor throughout much of the East, and
in particular in Egypt, whose grain supply was crucial to the
capital. Civil war seemed inevitable, and was prevented
only by Cassius’s assassination at the hands of a subordinate.
Marcus was nevertheless obliged to travel east to reassert
his authority, taking with him Faustina (who died in the
course of the journey). He visited the major cities of the East,
Antioch and Alexandria, arriving finally at Athens, where he
was initiated into the Eleusinian Mysteries, a set of mystic
rites connected with the worship of Demeter, the goddess of
agriculture.
Now in his fifties, Marcus was in declining health, and the
revolt of Cassius had only underlined the need to make
arrangements for the succession. Faustina had borne at least
thirteen children, many of whom had died young. By the mid-
170s, Marcus had only one surviving son, Commodus, just
entering his teens. There was no reason for Marcus to
continue the policy of adoption followed by his
predecessors, and there is no reason to think he even
considered it. The years that follow see Commodus’s rapid
promotion to a position not far short of co-emperor. He was
consul in 177 at the age of fifteen. In the same year he was
accorded all the major imperial privileges, except for the
post of Pontifex Maximus, the head of the Roman state
religion, held by the reigning emperor alone, and for life.
The gains of the Marcomannic Wars had not proved
==>> Page 21
permanent, and in 178, Marcus and Commodus marched
north again. Two years later Marcus died at age fifty-eight,
the first emperor to pass on the throne to his son since
Vespasian 
a 
century 
before. 
Sadly, 
Commodus’s
performance did not bear out whatever promise Marcus had
discerned in him. He was to be remembered as a dissolute
tyrant, a second Caligula or Nero whose many defects were
only emphasized by the contrast with his father. His
assassination after a twelve-year reign would usher in the
first in a series of power struggles that would burden the
empire for the next century.
Philosophical Background
The composition of the Meditations is normally dated to the
170s—Marcus’s last decade. That this was a dark and
stressful period for him can hardly be doubted. In the ten
years between 169 and 179 he had to cope with constant
fighting on the frontier, the abortive revolt of Cassius, and the
deaths of his colleague Verus; his wife, Faustina; and others.
Though he could hardly have anticipated the century of
turmoil that would follow his death, he may have suspected
that his son and successor, Commodus, was not the man he
hoped. That in these circumstances Marcus should have
sought consolation in philosophy is only natural. But
understanding 
what 
Marcus 
looked 
for 
from 
his
philosophical studies requires a certain amount of
==>> Page 22
orientation. To understand the Meditations in context, we
must familiarize ourselves not only with Stoicism, the
philosophical system that underlies the work, but also with
the role of philosophy in ancient life more generally.
Today philosophy is an academic discipline, one that few
people other than professional philosophers would consider
central to their everyday existence. While we may think of
ourselves as having a “philosophy of life,” it bears little
relation to what goes on in the philosophy departments of our
universities. The careers of twentieth-century analytic
philosophy often seem remote from what the American
philosopher Thomas Nagel terms “mortal questions”: the
problems involved in making ethical choices, constructing a
just society, responding to suffering and loss, and coming to
terms with the prospect of death. Indeed, most of us would be
inclined to see these issues as the province of religion rather
than philosophy.
For Marcus and his contemporaries, the situation was very
different. Ancient philosophy certainly had its academic side.
Athens and other large cities had publicly financed chairs of
philosophy, and professional philosophers taught, argued and
wrote, as they do today. But philosophy also had a more
practical dimension. It was not merely a subject to write or
argue about, but one that was expected to provide a “design
for living”—a set of rules to live one’s life by. This was a
need not met by ancient religion, which privileged ritual over
==>> Page 23
doctrine and provided little in the way of moral and ethical
guidelines. Nor did anyone expect it to. That was what
philosophy was for.
Philosophy in the modern sense is largely the creation of
one man, the fifth-century B.C. Athenian thinker Socrates. But
it is primarily in the Hellenistic period that we see the rise of
philosophical sects, promulgating coherent “belief systems”
that an individual could accept as a whole and which were
designed to explain the world in its totality. Of these
Hellenistic systems the most important, both for Romans in
general and for Marcus in particular, was the Stoic school.
The movement takes its name from the stoa (“porch” or
“portico”) in downtown Athens where its founder, Zeno
(332/3–262 B.C.), taught and lectured. Zeno’s doctrines were
reformulated and developed by his successors, Cleanthes
(331–232 B.C.) 
and 
Chrysippus 
(280–c. 
206 B.C.).
Chrysippus in particular was a voluminous writer, and it was
he who laid the foundations for systematic Stoicism. This
early “academic” Stoicism is the source of certain key terms
and concepts that reappear frequently in the Meditations, and
proper understanding of Marcus’s approach requires some
familiarity with the system as a whole.
Stoicism
Of the doctrines central to the Stoic worldview, perhaps the
most important is the unwavering conviction that the world is
==>> Page 24
organized in a rational and coherent way. More specifically,
it is controlled and directed by an all-pervading force that
the Stoics designated by the term logos. The term (from
which English “logic” and the suffix “-logy” derive) has a
semantic range so broad as to be almost untranslatable. At a
basic level it designates rational, connected thought—
whether envisioned as a characteristic (rationality, the ability
to reason) or as the product of that characteristic (an
intelligible utterance or a connected discourse). Logos
operates both in individuals and in the universe as a whole.
In individuals it is the faculty of reason. On a cosmic level it
is the rational principle that governs the organization of the
universe.1 In this sense it is synonymous with “nature,”
“Providence,” or “God.” (When the author of John’s Gospel
tells us that “the Word”—logos—was with God and is to be
identified with God, he is borrowing Stoic terminology.)
All events are determined by the logos, and follow in an
unbreakable chain of cause and effect. Stoicism is thus from
the outset a deterministic system that appears to leave no
room for human free will or moral responsibility. In reality
the Stoics were reluctant to accept such an arrangement, and
attempted to get around the difficulty by defining free will as
a voluntary accommodation to what is in any case inevitable.
According to this theory, man is like a dog tied to a moving
wagon. If the dog refuses to run along with the wagon he will
be dragged by it, yet the choice remains his: to run or be
dragged. In the same way, humans are responsible for their
==>> Page 25
choices and actions, even though these have been anticipated
by the logos and form part of its plan. Even actions which
appear to be—and indeed are—immoral or unjust advance
the overall design, which taken as a whole is harmonious and
good. They, too, are governed by the logos.
But the logos is not simply an impersonal power that
governs and directs the world. It is also an actual substance
that pervades that world, not in a metaphorical sense but in a
form as concrete as oxygen or carbon. In its physical
embodiment, 
the logos exists as pneuma, a substance
imagined by the earliest Stoics as pure fire, and by
Chrysippus as a mixture of fire and air. Pneuma is the power
—the vital breath—that animates animals and humans. It is,
in Dylan Thomas’s phrase, “the force that through the green
fuse drives the flower,” and is present even in lifeless
materials like stone or metal as the energy that holds the
object together—the internal tension that makes a stone a
stone. All objects are thus a compound of lifeless substance
and vital force. When Marcus refers, as he does on a number
of occasions, to “cause and material” he means the two
elements of these compounds—inert substance and animating
pneuma—which are united so long as the object itself exists.
When the object perishes, the pneuma that animated it is
reabsorbed into the logos as a whole. This process of
destruction and reintegration happens to individual objects at
every moment. It also happens on a larger scale to the entire
universe, which at vast intervals is entirely consumed by fire
==>> Page 26
(a process known as ekpyrosis), and then regenerated.2
If the world is indeed orderly, if the logos controls all
things, then the order it produces should be discernible in all
aspects of it. That supposition not only led the Stoics to
speculate about the nature of the physical world but also
motivated them to seek the rationality characteristic of the
logos in other areas, notably in formal logic and the nature
and structure of language (their interest in etymology is
reflected in several entries in the Meditations). This
systematizing impulse reappears in many other fields as well.
The catalogue of Chrysippus’s own works preserved by the
late-third-century biographer Diogenes Laertius is very long
indeed; it includes not only philosophical treatises in a
narrow sense, but also works such as “On How to Read
Poetry” and “Against the Touching Up of Paintings.” Later
Stoics would try their hands at history and anthropology as
well as more conventionally philosophical topics.
The expansion of Stoic thought was not only intellectual
but also geographical. The movement had been born in
Athens. In the century and a half that followed Chrysippus’s
death it spread to other centers, in particular to Rome. The
Romans of the second century B.C. were in the midst of a
course of conquest that by the end of the century would leave
them the effective masters of the Mediterranean. With
conquest came culture. Looking back on the rapid
Hellenization of the Roman aristocracy between 200 B.C. and
==>> Page 27
his own day, the poet Horace famously observed that
“conquered Greece was the true conqueror.” Nowhere is the
influence of Greece more obvious than in philosophy. Greek
philosophers, including the Stoics, Panaetius (c. 185–109
B.C.), and Posidonius (c. 135–50 B.C.), visited Rome to
lecture. Many spent extended periods there. In the first
century B.C. it became the fashion for young upper-class
Romans to study in Athens, in an ancient version of the
eighteenth-century Grand Tour. Roman aristocrats acted as
patrons to individual philosophers and assembled large
libraries of philosophical texts (like that at the famous Villa
of the Papyri at Herculaneum), and Romans like Cicero and
Lucretius attempted to expound Greek philosophical
doctrines in Latin.
Of the major philosophical schools, it was Stoicism that
had the greatest appeal. Unlike some other sects, the Stoics
had always approved of participation in public life, and this
stand struck a chord with the Roman aristocracy, whose code
of values placed a premium on political and military activity.
Stoicism has even been described, not altogether unfairly, as
the real religion of upper-class Romans. In the process it
became a rather different version of the philosophy from that
taught by Zeno and Chrysippus. Perhaps the most important
development was a shift in emphasis, a narrowing of focus.
Early and middle Stoicism was a holistic system. It aimed to
embrace all knowledge, and its focus was speculative and
theoretical. Roman Stoicism, by contrast, was a practical
==>> Page 28
discipline—not an abstract system of thought, but an attitude
to life. Partly for historical reasons, it is this Romanized
Stoicism that has most influenced later generations. Indeed,
the application of the adjective “stoic” to a person who
shows strength and courage in misfortune probably owes
more to the aristocratic Roman value system than it does to
Greek philosophers.
Stoicism in its later form was a system inspired as much
by individuals as by texts or doctrines. One of its most
distinguished adherents was Marcus Cato (known as Cato the
Younger to distinguish him from his great-grandfather,
prominent a century earlier). A senator of renowned rectitude
when Julius Caesar marched on Rome in 49 B.C., Cato sided
with Caesar’s rival Pompey in defense of the legitimate
government. When it was clear that Caesar would triumph,
Cato chose not to survive the Republic, killing himself after
the battle of Munda in 46. Within a century he had become an
emblem of Stoic resistance to tyranny. Under Nero he was
immortalized by the poet Lucan and praised in a laudatory
biography by the senator Thrasea Paetus, whose own
resistance to Nero cost him his life. Thrasea’s son-in-law,
Helvidius Priscus, played a similar role—and came to a
similar end—under Vespasian. Thrasea and Helvidius in
their turn served as role models to second-century aristocrats
like Marcus’s mentors Rusticus, Maximus, and Severus.
Marcus himself pays tribute to them (and to Cato) in
Meditations 1.14.
==>> Page 29
Cato, Thrasea, and Helvidius were doers, not writers, and
their legendary heroism inevitably lends them a somewhat
two-dimensional quality. A more complex and much more
interesting figure was the poet Lucan’s uncle, Lucius
Annaeus Seneca (c. 4 B.C.–A.D. 65), commonly known as
Seneca the Younger to distinguish him from his equally
distinguished father. Originally councillor to the young Nero,
he was eventually forced to commit suicide after being
implicated in an attempted coup against his erstwhile pupil.
Men’s lives are not always consistent with their ideals, and
some critics have found it hard to reconcile Seneca’s
fabulous wealth and his shameless flattery of Nero with his
philosophical views. Yet his works (in particular the Letters
to Lucilius) remain the most engaging and accessible
expressions of later Stoicism. Because they were written in
Latin they were also among the most influential on
succeeding generations.
But not all Stoics were wealthy senators. There was
another kind of Stoic exemplar as well: the outsider whose
ascetic lifestyle won him the admiration of his wealthier
contemporaries and enabled him to criticize the pretenses of
upper-class society with real authority. An early example of
the type is Gaius Musonius Rufus (c. 30–100), a member of
the Roman administrative class, the so-called knights
(equites), who was banished by both Nero and Vespasian. A
still more dramatic example was Musonius’s student
Epictetus (c. 55–c. 135), who had taken up the practice of
==>> Page 30
philosophy as a slave and devoted the remainder of his life
to it after being freed. He had been exiled to Nicopolis (in
northern Greece) under Domitian, and after the tyrant’s death,
elected to remain there where he taught and lectured to
visitors who often traveled great distances to study with him.
One of these was the upper-class historian and statesman
Arrian (c. 86–160), who published an extensive record of the
master’s discussions, a text conventionally referred to as the
Discourses of Epictetus. He later produced an abridged
version, 
the Encheiridion (“Manual” or “Handbook”).
Epictetus seems to have been an especially important figure
for Marcus. He thanks his philosophical mentor Rusticus for
introducing him to “Epictetus’s lectures” (either the
Discourses themselves or a private set of lecture notes), and
a series of quotations and paraphrases from the philosopher
appear in Book 11 of the Meditations. And Arrian’s
abridged Encheiridion provides the closest literary parallel
to the Meditations itself, not only in its content, but also in
its form: a series of relatively short and unrelated entries.
Stoicism and the Meditations
The late Stoicism of Epictetus is a radically stripped-down
version of its Hellenistic predecessor, a philosophy which
“had learnt much from its competitors and had almost
forgotten parts of itself.”3 Both these tendencies, the
narrowing of the field and the eclectic borrowing from non-
==>> Page 31
Stoic sources, can be discerned also in the Meditations.
Chrysippus and his followers had divided knowledge into
three 
areas: 
logic, 
physics 
and 
ethics, 
concerned,
respectively, with the nature of knowledge, the structure of
the physical world and the proper role of human beings in
that world. Marcus pays lip service to this triadic division in
at least one entry (8.13), but it is clear from other chapters
and from the Meditations as a whole that logic and physics
were not his focus. Among the things for which he thanks the
gods is that he was never “absorbed by logic-chopping, or
preoccupied by physics” (1.17). Occasional entries show an
awareness of Stoic thought about language (the etymological
pun in 8.57 is perhaps the clearest example), but they are the
exception, not the rule. In many cases Marcus’s logic is weak
—the logic of the rhetorician, not of the philosopher; it is
rare to find a developed chain of reasoning like that in
Meditations 4.4. His interest in the nature of the physical
world is limited to its relevance to human problems. About
one of the basic Stoic physical doctrines—the notion of the
periodic conflagration (ekpyrosis) that ends a cosmic cycle
—Marcus adopts an agnostic position (though he was not
alone in this). To him it was ethics that was the basis of the
system: “just because you’ve abandoned your hopes of
becoming a great thinker or scientist, don’t give up on
attaining freedom, achieving humility, serving others . . .”
(7.67).
==>> Page 32
The questions that the Meditations tries to answer are
primarily metaphysical and ethical ones: Why are we here?
How should we live our lives? How can we ensure that we
do what is right? How can we protect ourselves against the
stresses and pressures of daily life? How should we deal
with pain and misfortune? How can we live with the
knowledge that someday we will no longer exist? It would
be both pointless and impertinent to try to summarize
Marcus’s responses; the influence of the Meditations on later
readers springs in part from the clarity and insistence with
which he addresses these questions. It may be worthwhile,
however, to draw attention to one pattern of thought that is
central to the philosophy of the Meditations (as well as to
Epictetus), and that has been identified and documented in
detail by Pierre Hadot. This is the doctrine of the three
“disciplines”: the disciplines of perception, of action and of
the will.
The discipline of perception requires that we maintain
absolute objectivity of thought: that we see things
dispassionately for what they are. Proper understanding of
this point requires a brief introduction to the Stoic theory of
cognition. We have seen that for the Stoics universal order is
represented by the logos. The logos infuses and is wielded
by our hegemonikon (literally, “that which guides”), which
is the intellective part of our consciousness. In different
contexts it can approximate either “will” or “character” and
it performs many of the functions that English speakers
==>> Page 33
attribute to the brain or the heart.4 One of its primary
functions is to process and assess the data we receive from
our senses. At every instant the objects and events in the
world around us bombard us with impressions. As they do so
they produce a phantasia, a mental impression. From this the
mind generates a perception (hypolepsis), which might best
be compared to a print made from a photographic negative.
Ideally this print will be an accurate and faithful
representation of the original. But it may not be. It may be
blurred, or it may include shadow images that distort or
obscure the original.
Chief among these are inappropriate value judgments: the
designation as “good” or “evil” of things that in fact are
neither good nor evil. For example, my impression that my
house has just burned down is simply that—an impression or
report conveyed to me by my senses about an event in the
outside world. By contrast, my perception that my house has
burned down and I have thereby suffered a terrible tragedy
includes not only an impression, but also an interpretation
imposed upon that initial impression by my powers of
hypolepsis. It is by no means the only possible interpretation,
and I am not obliged to accept it. I may be a good deal better
off if I decline to do so. It is, in other words, not objects and
events but the interpretations we place on them that are the
problem. Our duty is therefore to exercise stringent control
over the faculty of perception, with the aim of protecting our
mind from error.
==>> Page 34
The second discipline, that of action, relates to our
relationship with other people. Human beings, for Marcus as
for the Stoics generally, are social animals, a point he makes
often (e.g., 5.16, 8.59, 9.1). All human beings possess not
only a share of the logos but also the ability to use it (that is
what makes us human and distinguishes us from other
animals). But it would perhaps be more accurate to say that
we are participants in the logos, which is as much a process
as a substance. Marcus himself more than once compares the
world ruled by logos to a city in which all human beings are
citizens, with all the duties inherent in citizenship. As human
beings we are part of nature, and our duty is to accommodate
ourselves to its demands and requirements—“to live as
nature requires,” as Marcus often puts it. To do this we must
make proper use of the logos we have been allotted, and
perform as best we can the functions assigned us in the
master plan of the larger, cosmic logos, of which it is a part.
This requires not merely passive acquiescence in what
happens, but active cooperation with the world, with fate
and, above all, with other human beings. We were made,
Marcus tells us over and over, not for ourselves but for
others, and our nature is fundamentally unselfish. In our
relationships with others we must work for their collective
good, while treating them justly and fairly as individuals.
Marcus never defines what he means by justice, and it is
important to recognize what the term implies and what it
==>> Page 35
does not. All human beings have a share of the logos, and all
have roles to play in the vast design that is the world. But
this is not to say that all humans are equal or that the roles
they are assigned are interchangeable. Marcus, like most of
his contemporaries, took it for granted that human society
was hierarchical, and this is borne out by the images he uses
to describe it. Human society is a single organism, like an
individual human body or a tree. But the trunk of the tree is
not to be confused with the leaves, or the hands and feet with
the head. Our duty to act justly does not mean that we must
treat others as our equals; it means that we must treat them as
they deserve. And their deserts are determined in part by
their position in the hierarchy. Stoicism’s emphasis on the
orderliness of the universe implies a similar orderliness and
harmony in its parts, and part of its appeal to upper-class
Romans may have been that it did not force its adherents to
ask difficult questions about the organization of the society
they lived in.5
The third discipline, the discipline of will, is in a sense
the counterpart to the second, the discipline of action. The
latter governs our approach to the things in our control, those
that we do; the discipline of will governs our attitude to
things that are not within our control, those that we have
done to us (by others or by nature). We control our own
actions and are responsible for them. If we act wrongly, then
we have done serious harm to ourselves (though not, it
should be emphasized, to others, or to the logos). By
==>> Page 36
contrast, things outside our control have no ability to harm
us. Acts of wrongdoing by a human agent (torture, theft, or
other crimes) harm the agent, not the victim. Acts of nature
such as fire, illness, or death can harm us only if we choose
to see them as harmful. When we do so, we question the
benevolence and providence of the logos, and thereby
degrade our own logos.
This, of course, we must not do. Instead we must see
things for what they are (here the discipline of perception is
relevant) and accept them, by exercising the discipline of
will, or what Epictetus calls (in a phrase quoted by Marcus)
“the art of acquiescence.” For if we recognize that all events
have been foreseen by the logos and form part of its plan,
and that the plan in question is unfailingly good (as it must
be), then it follows that we must accept whatever fate has in
store for us, however unpleasant it may appear, trusting that,
in Alexander Pope’s phrase, “whatever is, is right.” This
applies to all obstacles and (apparent) misfortunes, and in
particular to death—a process that we cannot prevent, which
therefore does not harm us, and which accordingly we must
accept willingly as natural and proper.
Together, the three disciplines constitute a comprehensive
approach to life, and in various combinations and
reformulations they underlie a large number of the entries in
the Meditations. We see them laid out starkly and explicitly
in Meditations 7.54:
==>> Page 37
Everywhere, at each moment, you have the option:
• to accept this event with humility [will];
• to treat this person as he should be treated [action];
• to approach this thought with care, so that nothing irrational creeps in
[perception].
We find the same triad rephrased and reordered in
Meditations 9.6: “Objective judgment . . . Unselfish action . .
. Willing acceptance . . . of all external events.”
And we find it in a more subtle form underlying
Meditations 8.7:
. . . progress for a rational mind means not accepting falsehood or uncertainty
in its perceptions, making unselfish actions its only aim, seeking and shunning
only the things it has control over, embracing what nature demands of it—the
nature in which it participates, as the leaf’s nature does in the tree’s.
A score of other entries could be cited. The almost obsessive
repetition of these three points suggests that they lie at the
very heart of Marcus’s thought, and of his project in the
Meditations.
==>> Page 38
Other Influences
Marcus Aurelius is often thought of and referred to as the
quintessential Stoic. Yet the only explicit reference to
Stoicism in the Meditations (5.10) is phrased in curiously
distant terms, as if it were merely one school among others.
The great figures of early Stoicism are conspicuous by their
absence. Neither Zeno nor Cleanthes is mentioned in the
Meditations, and Chrysippus appears only twice—quoted
once in passing for a pithy comparison (6.42) and included
with Socrates and Epictetus in a list of dead thinkers (7.19).
This is not to deny the essentially Stoic basis of Marcus’s
thought, or the deep influence on him exercised by later Stoic
thinkers (most obviously Epictetus). If he had to be identified
with a particular school, that is surely the one he would have
chosen. Yet I suspect that if asked what it was that he
studied, his answer would have been not “Stoicism” but
simply “philosophy.”
There is nothing surprising about this. The imperial period
saw the development of a widespread ecumenical tendency
in philosophy. Adherents of most of the major schools—the
Platonists, Peripatetics, Cynics, and Stoics—preferred to
focus on the points they shared, rather than those that
separated them. Not all the figures Marcus credits as
influential on his own philosophical development were
Stoics; Severus, for example, was a Peripatetic. Although
authors like Seneca and Epictetus accepted the basic
==>> Page 39
premises of the system developed by Zeno and Chrysippus,
they showed no reluctance to borrow aphorisms, anecdotes,
and argumentative strategies from non-Stoic sources. The
Meditations follows a similar procedure. While built on a
Stoic foundation, it also refers to and quotes a wide range of
figures, both precursors of the Stoics and representatives of
rival schools.
Of the predecessors Marcus invokes, the most important is
surely Socrates, the great Athenian thinker who had helped
redirect philosophy from a preoccupation with the physical
world to a focus on the role of man in society and the nature
of human morality. Socrates himself wrote nothing. His
teachings were transmitted (and greatly elaborated) in the
philosophical dialogues of his student Plato. Marcus quotes
Plato repeatedly (especially in Book 7), and Socratic or
Platonic elements can be discerned elsewhere too. One
example is the so-called Socratic paradox, the claim that no
one does wrong willingly, and that if men were able to
recognize what is right, they would inevitably do it. “They
are like this,” Marcus says of other people, “because they
can’t tell good from evil” (2.1), and he repeats this assertion
elsewhere.
Socrates’ character was as important as his doctrines. His
legendary endurance and self-denial made him an ideal
model for the Stoic philosopher—or any philosopher. His
refusal to compromise his philosophical beliefs led him to
==>> Page 40
make the ultimate sacrifice when he was put on trial at the
age of seventy on trumped-up charges of impiety. His display
of integrity at the trial and his comportment in the days
leading up to his execution made it easy to view him as a
forerunner of first-century Stoic martyrs like Thrasea Paetus
or Helvidius Priscus, and it is in this light that Marcus
evokes him in Meditations 7.66.
Of Socrates’ predecessors (the so-called pre-Socratic
thinkers), the most important, both for Marcus and the Stoics
generally, was Heraclitus, the mysterious figure from
Ephesus (in modern-day Turkey) whose Zenlike aphorisms
were proverbial for their profundity and obscurity alike.
Heraclitus’s philosophical system ascribed a central role to
logos and to fire as the primordial element. Both elements
were naturally congenial to the Stoics, and may well have
influenced them. Heraclitus is mentioned in a handful of
entries in the Meditations (4.46, 6.47), but his doctrines can
be traced in many others. Moreover, his concision and
epigrammatic phrasing anticipate the kind of enigmatic
apothegm we find in a number of entries:
The best revenge is not to be like that. (6.6)
Straight, not straightened. (7.12)
The fencer’s weapon is picked up and put down again. The boxer’s is part of
him. (12.9)
==>> Page 41
It is from Heraclitus that Marcus derives one of his most
memorable motifs, that of the unstable flux of time and matter
in which we move. “We cannot step twice into the same
river,” Heraclitus had said, and we see Marcus expanding on
the observation: “Time is a river, a violent current of events,
glimpsed once and already carried past us, and another
follows and is gone” (4.43; and compare 2.17, 6.15).
Though Heraclitus was clearly the pre-Socratic who most
influenced Marcus, other thinkers leave traces as well.
Marcus twice borrows the poet Empedocles’ image of the
self-contained soul as a perfect sphere (8.41, 12.3), and he
alludes once to the mystic doctrines of the Pythagoreans
(11.27). Several entries explore the implications of phrases
attributed to Democritus, one of the inventors of the theory of
atoms, which would later inspire the Hellenistic philosopher
Epicurus.
Neither Heraclitus nor Socrates had founded a school.
That was an achievement reserved for Plato, and then for
Plato’s student Aristotle, who broke from his master to found
the Peripatetic movement. Marcus never refers to Aristotle,
though he does quote approvingly from the latter’s successor
Theophrastus (2.10). Probably more important was another
fourth-century B.C. movement: Cynicism. The Cynics, of
whom the first and most notorious was the irascible
==>> Page 42
Diogenes of Sinope, were united less by doctrine than by a
common attitude, namely their contempt for societal
institutions and a desire for a life more in accord with nature.
Diogenes himself was largely responsible for the image of a
philosopher as an impoverished ascetic (the “philosopher
without clothes” evoked by Marcus at Meditations 4.30
might well be a Cynic). His famous claim to be a “citizen of
the world” surely anticipates, if it did not actually influence,
the Stoic conception of the world as a city-state. Marcus
refers to Diogenes in several passages, as well as to the
latter’s student Monimus (2.15), and invokes another Cynic,
Crates, at Meditations 6.13, in an anecdote whose tenor is
now uncertain.
Marcus’s relationship to Epicureanism, Stoicism’s great
rival among Hellenistic philosophical systems, is much more
vexed. The followers of Epicurus (341–270 B.C.) believed in
a universe radically unlike that posited by Zeno and
Chrysippus. The Stoic world is ordered to the nth degree; the
Epicurean universe is random, the product of the haphazard
conjunctions of billions of atoms. To speak of Providence in
such a world is transparently absurd, and while Epicurus
acknowledged the existence of gods, he denied that they took
any interest in human life. As for humans, our role is simply
to live as best we can, making the most of what pleasures are
available to us and insulating ourselves as far as possible
from pain and anxiety. In particular, we are to feel no anxiety
about death, which consists simply in the dissolution of our
==>> Page 43
component atoms. This process is not only inevitable, but
harmless, for the simple reason that after death there is no
“us” to suffer harm.
Although the sect numbered not a few prominent Romans
among its adherents, it never attained the success of
Stoicism, and was regarded with genial contempt by most
outsiders. The quietism endorsed by the Epicureans was
obviously difficult to reconcile with an active public life—
an important Roman value—and the Epicurean equation of
the good with pleasure was bound to raise eyebrows among
conservative Romans. “Eat, drink and be merry” was
popularly supposed to be the Epicureans’ motto, though
Epicurus himself had been quite explicit in identifying
pleasure with intellectual contemplation rather than the
vulgar enjoyment of food and sex. Though a minority view,
Epicureanism was, nonetheless, the only potential rival to
Stoicism in offering a systematic cosmology, as Marcus
acknowledges on a number of occasions by the stark
dichotomy “Providence or atoms” (4.3, 10.6, 11.18, 12.14).
Marcus normally seems to view Epicureanism with
disapproval (as we would expect). In Meditations 6.10 he
contrasts the Epicurean universe, founded on “mixture,
interaction, dispersal” with the components of the Stoic
system: “unity, order, design”—clearly to the advantage of
the latter. Should we not be ashamed to fear death, he asks in
another entry, when “even” the Epicureans disdain it?
==>> Page 44
(12.34). But other entries suggest a less dismissive attitude.
Marcus quotes with apparent approval Epicurus’s account of
his own exemplary conduct during an illness (9.41) and
twice seeks comfort in the philosopher’s remarks on the
endurance of pain (7.33, 7.64). Like other late Stoics
(Seneca is a notable example), he was willing to accept truth
wherever he found it.
Thus far we have been concerned with the content of the
Meditations: the ethical doctrine of late Stoicism,
incorporating a certain amount of Platonic and Heraclitean
material, and overlaid with occasional reference to other
schools and thinkers. But what of the Meditations itself?
How and why was it written? Who is its audience? What
kind of book is it? For the answers to these questions we
must turn from the book’s content to its form and origins.
The MEDITATIONS: Genre, Structure, and Style
I suspect that Marcus would have been surprised (and
perhaps rather dismayed) to find himself enshrined in the
Modern Library of the World’s Best Books. He would have
been surprised, to begin with, by the title of the work
ascribed to him. The long-established English title
Meditations is not only not original, but positively
misleading, lending a spurious air of resonance and authority
quite alien to the haphazard set of notes that constitute the
==>> Page 45
book. In the lost Greek manuscript used for the first printed
edition—itself many generations removed from Marcus’s
original—the work was entitled “To Himself” (Eis
heauton). This is no more likely than Meditations to be the
original title, though it is at least a somewhat more accurate
description of the work.6
In fact, it seems unlikely that Marcus himself gave the
work any title at all, for the simple reason that he did not
think of it as an organic whole in the first place. Not only
was it not written for publication, but Marcus clearly had no
expectation that anyone but himself would ever read it. The
entries include a number of cryptic references to persons or
events that an ancient reader would have found as
unintelligible as we do. While a contemporary might have
recognized some of the figures mentioned in Meditations
8.25 or 12.27, for example, no ancient reader could have
known what was in the letter that Rusticus wrote from
Sinuessa (1.7), what Antoninus said to the customs agent at
Tusculum (1.16), or what happened to Marcus at Caieta
(1.17). Elsewhere Marcus reflects directly on his role as
emperor, in terms that would be quite irrelevant to anyone
else. We find him worrying about the dangers of becoming
“imperialized” (6.30), reminding himself to speak simply in
the Senate (8.30), and reflecting on the unique position he
occupies (11.7). From these entries and others it seems clear
that the “you” of the text is not a generic “you,” but the
emperor himself. “When you look at yourself, see any of the
==>> Page 46
emperors” (10.31).
How are we to categorize the Meditations? It is not a
diary, at least in the conventional sense. The entries contain
little or nothing related to Marcus’s day-to-day life: few
names, no dates and, with two exceptions, no places. It also
lacks the sense of audience—the reader over one’s shoulder
—that tends to characterize even the most secretive diarist.
Some scholars have seen it as the basis for an unwritten
larger treatise, like Pascal’s Pensées or the notebooks of
Joseph Joubert. Yet the notes are too repetitive and, in a
philosophical sense, too elementary for that. The entries
perhaps bear a somewhat closer resemblance to the working
notes of a practicing philosopher: Wittgenstein’s Zettel, say,
or the Cahiers of Simone Weil. Yet here, too, there is a
significant difference. The Meditations is not tentative and
exploratory, like the notes of Wittgenstein or Weil, and it
contains little or nothing that is original. It suggests not a
mind recording new perceptions or experimenting with new
arguments, but one obsessively repeating and reframing ideas
long familiar but imperfectly absorbed.
Perhaps the best description of the entries is that suggested
by the French scholar Pierre Hadot. They are “spiritual
exercises” composed to provide a momentary stay against the
stress and confusion of everyday life: a self-help book in the
most literal sense. A revealing comment in this context is
Meditations 5.9, where Marcus reminds himself “not to think
==>> Page 47
of philosophy as your instructor, but as the sponge and egg
white that relieve ophthalmia—as a soothing ointment.” On
this reading, the individual entries were composed not as a
record of Marcus’s thoughts or to enlighten others, but for his
own use, as a means of practicing and reinforcing his own
philosophical convictions. Such an interpretation accounts
for several aspects of the entries that would otherwise be
puzzling. It explains the predominance of the imperative in
the text; its purpose is not to describe or reflect (let alone to
“meditate”), but to urge, direct, and exhort.7 And it explains
also the repetitiveness that strikes any reader of the work
almost immediately—the continual circling back to the same
few problems. The entries do not present new answers or
novel solutions to these problems, but only familiar answers
reframed. It was precisely this process of reframing and
reexpressing that Marcus found helpful.
The recognition that the entries are as much process as
product also accounts for the shapelessness and apparent
disorder of the work. We do not know by whom or on what
basis the individual books of the Meditations were arranged;
the order may be chronological, or partly chronological, or
wholly arbitrary. The arrangement of the individual entries
may or may not be Marcus’s own, though its very
randomness suggests that it goes back to the author (a later
editor would have been tempted to group together
thematically similar entries, and perhaps to tie up some of the
more obvious loose ends). Nor can we always be sure where
==>> Page 48
individual entries begin and end; in some cases this is a
question Marcus himself might not have been able to
answer.8
A special position is occupied by Book 1, which is
distinguished 
from 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
work 
by 
its
autobiographical nature and by the greater impression of
conscious design and ordering apparent in it. It consists of
seventeen entries in which Marcus reflects on what he
learned from various individuals in his life, either directly or
from their example (hence the title I have given the section
here, “Debts and Lessons,” which has no warrant in the
transmitted text). The entries roughly mirror the chronology
of Marcus’s early life, from his older relatives to his
teachers to his adopted father, Antoninus, and ultimately to
the gods.9 This logical schema, as well as the increasing
length of the entries, suggests deliberate arrangement,
presumably by Marcus himself. If so, then this book, at least,
was conceived as an organic whole. It may be among the
latest portions of the text, if scholars are correct in thinking
(as most do) that the short sketch of Antoninus Pius in
Meditations 6.30 was the starting point for the longer
memoir in 1.16.
Attempts to find organic unity in the remaining books or
development from book to book are doomed to failure.
Wherever one opens the Meditations (with the exception of
==>> Page 49
Book 1) we find the same voice, the same themes; Marcus’s
thought does not change or develop noticeably from one book
to another. Nor can any structure or unity be discerned within
individual books. It seems most likely that the division
between books is a purely physical one. The transmitted
“books,” in other words, represent the individual papyrus
rolls of Marcus’s original, or perhaps of a later copy. When
one had been filled, another was begun.10
If the books as a whole are homogenous, the individual
entries show considerable formal variety. Some are
developed short essays that make a single philosophical
point; many of the entries in Books 2 and 3 are of this type.
Others are straightforward imperatives (“Take the shortest
route . . .”) or aphorisms (“no one can keep you from living
in harmony with yourself”). Sometimes Marcus will list a
number of basic principles in catalogue format (“remember
that . . . and that . . . and that . . .”). Elsewhere he puts
forward an analogy, sometimes with the point of comparison
left to be inferred. Thus human lives are like “many lumps of
incense on the same altar” (4.15) or like “a rock thrown in
the air” (9.17). In other cases the analogy will be made
explicit: “Have you ever seen a severed hand or foot . . . ?
That’s what we do to ourselves . . . when we rebel against
what happens to us” (8.34). Others present a kind of formal
meditative exercise, as when Marcus instructs himself to
imagine the age of Vespasian (4.32) or Augustus’s court
(8.31) and then to compare the imagined scene with that of
==>> Page 50
his own time. Portions of two books (7 and 11) consist
simply of quotations. Some entries appear to be rough drafts
for others; several of the raw quotations from tragedies in
Book 7 are incorporated in the much more polished
Meditations 11.6. The significance of some entries remains
completely obscure. Few critics have known what to make of
notes like “Character: dark, womanish, obstinate” (4.28) or
“They don’t realize how much is included in stealing,
sowing, buying . . .” (3.15).
The entries also differ considerably in the degree of
artistry they display. Some entries are little more than
Marcus’s notes or reminders to himself—the philosophical
equivalent of “Phone Dr. re appt. Tues.?” But others are
highly literary. Marcus wrote as a man trained in the
rhetorical techniques of the second century. His thoughts
naturally took on the impress of his training and intellectual
milieu even when he was writing for himself alone.
The shorter entries often display an interest in wordplay
and a striving for epigrammatic brevity that recalls both the
ingenuity of the rhetorical schools and the paradoxical
compression of Heraclitus:
Does the sun try to do the rain’s work? Or Asclepius Demeter’s? (6.43)
Evil: the same old thing. (7.1)
==>> Page 51
Not a dancer but a wrestler . . . (7.61)
To accept it without arrogance, to let it go with indifference. (8.33)
The philosophical tradition may have been influential on
another element that we find occasionally: the intermittent
snatches of dialogue or quasi-dialogue. As a developed
form, the philosophical dialogue goes back to Plato, who
was imitated by later philosophers, notably Aristotle (in his
lost works) and Cicero. The Meditations certainly does not
contain the kind of elaborate scene setting that we expect in a
true dialogue, but we do find in a number of entries a kind of
internal debate in which the questions or objections of an
imaginary interlocutor are answered by a second, calmer
voice which corrects or rebukes its errors. The first voice
seems to represent Marcus’s weaker, human side; the second
is the voice of philosophy.
The longer entries (none, of course, are very long) are
marked by a coherent if sometimes slightly labored style. Not
all critics have had kind words for Marcus’s expository
prose, and some have been inclined to attribute perceived
shortcomings to deficiencies in his Greek. But in all
likelihood the occasional awkwardness is due less to an
imperfect grasp of the language than to roughness of
composition—Marcus thinking aloud or groping for an idea.
The same explanation may underlie one of the most
==>> Page 52
noticeable features of Marcus’s prose—namely, his tendency
to string together pairs of near-synonymous words and
phrases, as if uncertain whether he has hit the target the first
time. When combined with the very abstract vocabulary
natural in philosophical prose, this can make for difficult
reading, especially in English, which privileges concision
and concrete vocabulary to a greater degree than Greek. At
its best, however, Marcus’s writing can be extraordinarily
effective, most of all when it strikes a balance between
image and idea, as in the opening of 5.23:
Keep in mind how fast things pass by and are gone—those that are now, and
those to come. Existence flows past us like a river: the “what” is in constant
flux, the “why” has a thousand variations. Nothing is stable, not even what’s
right here. The infinity of past and future gapes before us—a chasm whose
depths we cannot see.
This particular topic—the transience of human life, the
constant change that shapes and informs the world—is a
recurrent theme in the Meditations, and as we shall see, it is
one whose treatment owes as much to literary as to
philosophical models, and as much to Marcus’s own
character as to Stoic doctrine.
Recurring Themes
==>> Page 53
To try to extract a sustained and coherent argument from the
Meditations as a whole would be an unprofitable exercise. It
is simply not that kind of work. It would be equally fruitless
to try to read autobiographical elements into individual
entries (to take 9.42 as referring to the revolt of Avidius
Cassius, for example, or 10.4 as a reflection on Commodus)
—all the more so since so few of the entries can be dated
with any security. This is not to say that the Meditations has
no unity or no relationship to Marcus’s own life, for it has
both. What unifies it is the recurrence of a small number of
themes that surely reflect Marcus’s own preoccupations. It is
the points to which Marcus returns most often that offer the
best insight into his character and concerns.
One example that will strike almost any reader is the sense
of mortality that pervades the work. Death is not to be feared,
Marcus continually reminds himself. It is a natural process,
part of the continual change that forms the world. At other
points it is the ultimate consolation. “Soon you will be
dead,” Marcus tells himself on a number of occasions, “and
none of it will matter” (cf. 4.6, 7.22, 8.2). The emphasis on
the vanity and worthlessness of earthly concerns is here
linked to the more general idea of transience. All things
change or pass away, perish and are forgotten. This is the
burden of several of the thought exercises that Marcus sets
himself: to think of the court of Augustus (8.31), of the age of
Vespasian or Trajan (4.32), the great philosophers and
thinkers of the past (6.47)—all now dust and ashes.
==>> Page 54
This theme is not specific to Stoicism. We meet it at every
turn in ancient literature. Marcus himself quotes the famous
passage in Book 6 of Homer’s Iliad in which the lives of
mortals are compared to leaves that grow in the spring,
flourish for a season and then fall and die, to be replaced by
others (10.34). He would have recognized the sentiment in
other writers too, from the melancholy Greek lyric poet
Mimnermus, who develops and expands on Homer’s simile,
to the Roman lawyer Servius Sulpicius, writing to his friend
Cicero on the death of the latter’s daughter:
I want to share with you something that brought me not a little consolation, in
hopes that it might have the same effect on you. On my way back from Asia,
on the voyage from Aegina to Megara, I gazed at the lands we passed.
Aegina was behind me, Megara before me, Piraeus on the starboard side,
Corinth to port—towns which flourished once upon a time, and now lie fallen
and in ruins before our eyes—and I said to myself, “Alas! . . . and will you,
Servius, not restrain your grief and recall that you were born a mortal?”
Believe me, the thought was no small consolation to me.
This is not a point modern grief counselors would be
inclined to dwell on, but it is one that Marcus would have
understood perfectly, and its appeal to him casts light on both
his character and his background. Marcus may have been a
Stoic, but he was also a Roman, influenced not only by Zeno
and Chrysippus but by Homer and Vergil. Vergil is nowhere
mentioned in the Meditations, and in a Greek work could
==>> Page 55
hardly be quoted or alluded to, but there is a note of
melancholy that runs through the work that one can only call
Vergilian.
Other concerns surface as well. A number of entries
discuss methods of dealing with pain or bodily weakness of
other sorts. “When you have trouble getting out of bed . . .”
begin several entries (5.1, 8.12). A persistent motif is the
need to restrain anger and irritation with other people, to put
up with their incompetence or malice, to show them the
errors of their ways. Several entries focus on the frustrations
of life at court, nowhere more present than when Marcus tells
himself to stop complaining about them (8.9). He contrasts
the court against philosophy as a stepmother against a mother
—to be visited out of duty, but not someone we can really
love (6.12). Yet the court need not be an obstacle: it can be a
challenge, even an opportunity. One can lead a good life
anywhere, even at court, as Antoninus showed (5.16, 1.16).
“No role [is] so well suited to philosophy,” Marcus tells
himself, “as the one you happen to be in right now” (11.7).
A more subtle clue to Marcus’s personality is the imagery
that he prefers. It is worth noting, for example, how many
images of nature occur in the Meditations. Many readers
have been struck by Meditations 3.2, with its evocation of
“nature’s inadvertence” in baking bread or ripening figs,
olives, and stalks of wheat. Metaphors and offhand
comparisons in other entries evoke the pastoral and
==>> Page 56
agricultural rhythms of the Mediterranean world, with its
flocks, herds, and vines, its seasons of sowing and
harvesting, its grapes drying slowly into raisins. Some of
these may be stock examples, but even a stock example can
be revealing. One can hardly read a page of Plato without
tripping over the helmsmen, doctors, shoemakers, and other
craftsmen who populated ancient Athens; such figures are
much rarer in Marcus. The image of society as a tree whose
branches are individual human beings expresses an important
Stoic principle, but the image is developed further than one
might expect and informed by what might be personal
observation: “You can see the difference between the branch
that’s been there since the beginning, remaining on the tree
and growing with it, and the one that’s been cut off and
grafted back.”
Affection for the natural world contrasts with a persistent
sense of disgust and contempt for human life and other human
beings—a sense that it is difficult to derive from (or even
reconcile with) Stoicism. As P. A. Brunt puts it, “Reason
told Marcus that the world was good beyond improvement,
and yet it constantly appeared to him evil beyond remedy.”
The courtiers who surround him are vain and obsequious,
while the people he deals with on a daily basis are
“meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and
surly” (2.1). One of the most frequently recurring points in
the Meditations is the reminder that human beings are social
animals, as if this was a point Marcus had a particularly hard
==>> Page 57
time accepting. The gods care for mortals, he reminds
himself, “and you—on the verge of death—you still refuse to
care for them.”
There is a persistent strain of pessimism in the work. “The
things we want in life are empty, stale, and trivial. Dogs
snarling at each other. Quarreling children—laughing and
then bursting into tears a moment later. Trust, shame, justice,
truth—‘gone from the earth and only found in heaven.’ Why
are you still here?” (5.33). Images of dirt appear in several
entries. The world around us resembles the baths: “oil,
sweat, dirt, grayish water, all of it disgusting” (8.24). If
Marcus contemplates the stars, he does so only in order to
“wash off the mud of life below” (7.47). And the objective
analysis Marcus prizes often shades over into a depressing
cynicism (in the modern sense of the term). “Disgust at what
things are made of: Liquid, dust, bones, filth. Or marble as
hardened dirt, gold and silver as residues, clothes as hair,
purple dye as shellfish blood. And all the rest” (9.36). The
human body itself is no more than “rotting meat in a bag”
(8.38). “[D]espise your flesh. A mess of blood, pieces of
bone, a woven tangle of nerves, veins, arteries” (2.2).
Perhaps the most depressing entry in the entire work is the
one in which Marcus urges himself to cultivate an
indifference to music (11.2).
As one scholar has observed, “reading the Meditations for
long periods can be conducive of melancholy.” And even
==>> Page 58
those who love the book cannot deny that there is something
impoverishing about the view of human life it presents.
Matthew Arnold, whose essay on the work reveals a deep
respect and affection for Marcus, identified the central
shortcoming of his philosophy as its failure to make any
allowance for joy, and I think this is a fair criticism. Marcus
does not offer us a means of achieving happiness, but only a
means of resisting pain. The Stoicism of the Meditations is
fundamentally a defensive philosophy; it is noteworthy how
many military images recur, from references to the soul as
being “posted” or “stationed” to the famous image of the
mind as an invulnerable fortress (8.48). Such images are not
unique to Marcus, but one can imagine that they might have
had special meaning for an emperor whose last years were
spent in “warfare and a journey far from home” (2.17). For
Marcus, life was a battle, and often it must have seemed—
what in some sense it must always be—a losing battle.
There are also a handful of points in the text where we
have glimpses of a different frame of mind, most obviously
when Marcus refers to the gods. From a Stoic perspective, of
course, “God” or “the gods” (the terms are used
interchangeably by many ancient writers) are merely
conventional terms for what we might equally well call
“nature” or “the logos” or “Providence,” or simply “how
things are.” Marcus stresses the benevolence of this power
(what is divine must be good, surely?), but it is clear that he
also ascribes to its actions the implacability with which
==>> Page 59
orthodox Stoic doctrine endows it. It is not easy to see why
one should pray to a power whose decisions one can hardly
hope to influence, and indeed Marcus several times seems to
admit the possibility that one should not (5.7, 6.44, 9.40).
It is all the more surprising, then, to find Marcus
elsewhere suggesting a more personal concern on the gods’
part. The final entry of Book 1 is the most obvious example.
Here Marcus indicates that the gods have aided him quite
directly “through their gifts, their help, their inspiration,” just
as they have others (cf. 9.11). Their help is curiously
concrete. Among the things for which they are thanked are
“remedies granted through dreams,” including “the one at
Caieta” (1.17; the text is uncertain). The gods also assist
other people, he reminds himself, “just as they do you—by
signs and dreams and every other way” (9.27). That Marcus
himself did believe deeply in the gods, not merely as a figure
of speech but as a real force in his own life, is suggested by
his refutation of those who doubt their existence: “I know the
gods exist. . . .—from having felt their power, over and
over” (12.28). How was this personal relationship with the
divine to be reconciled with the impersonal logos of the
Stoics? The question seems to be played out in the dialogue
at Meditations 9.40. “But those are things the gods left up to
me,” protests one voice, to which another responds, “And
what makes you think the gods don’t care about what’s up to
us?” Marcus himself may not have fully recognized or
acknowledged this conflict, but its existence may point to a
==>> Page 60
half-conscious awareness that the answer Stoicism offered
was not in every respect satisfactory.
Later Influence
How or by whom the Meditations was preserved is
unknown. The late-fourth-century Historia Augusta paints a
picture of Marcus lecturing on the Meditations to a
spellbound audience at Rome—one of the charming fantasies
in which that peculiar work abounds, but certainly an
invention. The passage does suggest, however, that the text
was in circulation by the fourth century, when it is also
mentioned by the orator Themistius. It was very likely
familiar also to a contemporary of Themistius’s, the neo-
pagan emperor Julian (known to later ages as Julian the
Apostate), in whose dialogue “The Caesars” Marcus is
pictured as a model for the kind of philosopher-king that
Julian himself aspired to be.
The century that followed Themistius and Julian was one
of decline, at least in the West—decline in political
institutions, and also in the knowledge of Greek. For the next
thousand years Marcus’s work, like that of Homer and
Euripides, would remain unknown to Western readers.
Copies survived in the Greek-speaking East, of course, but
even there the Meditations seems to have been little read.
For centuries, all trace of it is lost, until at the beginning of
==>> Page 61
the tenth century it reappears in a letter from the scholar and
churchman Arethas, who writes to a friend, “I have had for a
while now a copy of the Emperor Marcus’s invaluable book.
It was not only old but practically coming apart. . . . I have
had it copied and can now pass it on to posterity in better
shape.” Whether Arethas’s copy was indeed responsible for
the work’s survival we do not know. At any rate, its
readership seems to have increased in the centuries that
followed. It is quoted a generation or two later by the vast
Byzantine encyclopedia known as the Suda, and it was
perhaps around this period also that an unknown Byzantine
poet composed a brief appreciation that came to be copied
along with the text:
ON THE BOOK OF MARCUS
If you desire to master pain
Unroll this book and read with care,
And in it find abundantly
A knowledge of the things that are,
Those that have been, and those to come.
And know as well that joy and grief
Are nothing more than empty smoke.
==>> Page 62
The fall of Constantinople to the Turks in 1453 led to an
exodus of scholars, bringing with them the Greek texts that
inspired the Italian Renaissance. The Meditations must have
been among them. Yet even at this date the work’s survival
hung by a thread. The only complete manuscript to survive is
a fourteenth-century codex (now in the Vatican), which is
riddled with errors. The first printed edition did not appear
until 1559, when Wilhelm Holzmann (known as Xylander)
produced a text from what seems to have been a more
reliable manuscript. That manuscript, unfortunately, has not
survived. But even at its best it was a very imperfect witness
to what Marcus himself wrote. Our text of the Meditations
contains a number of passages that are garbled or in which
one or more crucial words seem to have been omitted. Some
of these errors may be due to the confused state of Marcus’s
original copy. Others may have been accidentally introduced
in the course of the copying and recopying that the work
underwent in the millennium following Marcus’s death. In
some cases the informed guesswork of scholars over several
centuries has been able to restore the original text. In others,
there is still uncertainty.11
The Meditations has never attracted great interest from
professional students of the classics, and the reasons are
perhaps understandable. It contains few direct references to
historical events and provides relatively little material for
social historians. As evidence for later Stoicism it pales
==>> Page 63
beside the greater bulk of Epictetus’s Discourses. Yet it has
always exerted a fascination on those outside the narrow
orbit of classical study, perhaps especially on those who can
best appreciate the pressures that Marcus himself faced. The
Meditations was among the favorite reading of Frederick the
Great; a recent American president has claimed to reread it
every few years. But it has attracted others too, from poets
like Pope, Goethe, and Arnold to the southern planter
William 
Alexander 
Percy, 
who 
observed 
in 
his
autobiography that “there is left to each of us, no matter how
far defeat pierces, the unassailable wintry kingdom of
Marcus Aurelius. . . . It is not outside, but within, and when
all is lost, it stands fast.”12
If Marcus has been studied less than many ancient authors,
he has been translated more than most. But it has been a
generation since his last English incarnation, and the time
seems ripe for another attempt. My intention in what follows
has been to represent in readable English both the content
and the texture of the Meditations. I have been especially
concerned to convey the patchwork character of the original,
both the epigrammatic concision that characterizes some
entries and the straggling discursiveness of others. I hope the
results will bear out my conviction that what a Roman
emperor wrote long ago for his own use can still be
meaningful to those far removed from him in time and space.
We do not live in Marcus’s world, but it is not as remote
from us as we sometimes imagine. There could be no better
==>> Page 64
witness to the effect of the Meditations on a modern reader
than the Russian poet Joseph Brodsky, whose essay “Homage
to Marcus Aurelius” takes its departure from the famous
statue of the emperor on the Capitoline hill in Rome:
I saw him for the last time a few years ago, on a wet winter night, in the
company of a stray Dalmatian. I was returning by taxi to my hotel after one
of the most disastrous evenings in my entire life. The next morning I was
leaving Rome for the States. I was drunk. The traffic moved with the speed
one wishes for one’s funeral. At the foot of the Capitol I asked the driver to
stop, paid, and got out of the car. . . . Presently I discovered I was not alone:
a middle-sized Dalmatian appeared out of nowhere and quietly sat down a
couple of feet away. Its sudden presence was so oddly comforting that
momentarily I felt like offering it one of my cigarettes. . . . For a while we
both stared at the horseman’s statue. . . . And suddenly—presumably
because of the rain and the rhythmic pattern of Michelangelo’s pilasters and
arches—all got blurred, and against that blur, the shining statue, devoid of any
geometry, seemed to be moving. Not at great speed, and not out of this place;
but enough for the Dalmatian to leave my side and follow the bronze
progress.
FURTHER READING
The standard modern biography of Marcus is A. R. Birley,
Marcus Aurelius (1966; rev. ed., New Haven, Conn.: Yale
University Press, 1987), which makes full use of the
principal ancient literary sources—not only the Meditations
(especially Book 1), but the remains of the history of Dio
Cassius, the letters of Fronto and the biography of Marcus in
==>> Page 65
the so-called Historia Augusta. Birley also draws on recent
research into the careers of upper-class officeholders
(prosopography) and the workings of the imperial
administration to paint a picture of Marcus’s background and
the society he moved in.
The most comprehensive and reliable treatment of the
Antonine age can be found in the Cambridge Ancient
History, volume XI, The High Empire, A.D. 70–192
(Cambridge University Press, 2000). Edward Gibbon’s
famous characterization of the period in the opening chapters
of his History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire
remains well worth reading, although the picture it paints
may be too rosy-colored. A useful counterbalance is E. R.
Dodds, Pagan and Christian in an Age of Anxiety
(Cambridge, Eng.: Cambridge University Press, 1965),
which offers a very different assessment of the period.
Treatments of special topics abound, and only a few titles
can be mentioned. The upper-class education that Marcus
enjoyed is described by S. F. Bonner, Education in Ancient
Rome (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1977). E.
Champlin’s Fronto and Antonine Rome (Cambridge, Mass.:
Harvard University Press, 1980) is the best modern study of
Marcus’s teacher. Glen Bowersock’s Greek Sophists in the
Roman Empire (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1969) is a
fundamental study of intellectual culture in the second
century. Fergus Millar’s The Emperor in the Roman World
==>> Page 66
(Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1977) is an
exhaustive analysis of the civil and administrative functions
performed 
by 
Marcus 
and 
his 
fellow 
emperors,
complemented for military matters by J. B. Campbell’s The
Emperor and the Roman Army (Oxford: Oxford University
Press, 1984).
Most of the major ancient sources for Marcus and his
world are conveniently printed with facing-page English
translations in the Loeb Classical Library. The valuable but
highly unreliable life of Marcus in the Historia Augusta can
be found in the three volumes of Scriptores Historiae
Augustae, trans. D. Magie (1921–1932), as well as in A.
Birley, trans., Lives of the Later Caesars (New York:
Penguin, 1976). The Loeb series also includes the letters of
Fronto, trans. C. R. Haines (2 volumes, 1919); and of the
historian Dio Cassius, trans. E. Cary (9 volumes, 1914–
1927, of which the last two are relevant to Marcus).
Although composed and collected a generation before
Marcus’s birth, the Letters of Pliny the Younger,  trans. Betty
Radice (2 volumes, 1969), are a rich and illuminating source
for upper-class society in the mid-empire. Insight into the
intellectual life of the period can be gained from the Attic
Nights of the antiquarian Aulus Gellius, trans. J. C. Rolfe (3
volumes, 1927), the works of the satirist Lucian, trans. A. M.
Harmon, K. Kilburn and M. D. MacLeod (8 volumes, 1913–
1967), and Philostratus’s entertaining Lives of the Sophists,
trans. W. C. Wright (1921). Finally, mention should be made
==>> Page 67
of two modern novels set in the Antonine period, Walter
Pater ’s Marius the Epicurean (1885) and Marguerite
Yourcenar’s Memoirs of Hadrian (1951). Neither should be
mistaken for a primary source, but each is, in its different
way, a masterpiece.
Recent work on Hellenistic philosophy has done much to
illuminate the philosophical background of the Meditations.
A clear and helpful introduction to both Stoicism and
Epicureanism can be found in A. A. Long, Hellenistic
Philosophy (London: Duckworth, 1974); on a much larger
scale is Keimpe Algra, Jonathan Barnes and Jaap Mansfeld,
eds., The Cambridge History of Hellenistic Philosophy
(New York: Cambridge University Press, 1999). On
Stoicism see also F. H. Sandbach, The Stoics (London:
Chatto and Windus, 1975), and J. Rist, Stoic Philosophy
(Cambridge, Eng.: Cambridge University Press, 1969). The
works of the two most important Stoics, Zeno and
Chrysippus, are largely lost; their surviving fragments are
translated in the first volume of A. A. Long and David
Sedl ey, The 
Hellenistic 
Philosophers 
(New 
York:
Cambridge University Press, 1987), which also includes
much material on Epicureanism. An important source for the
history of both schools is Diogenes Laertius’s Lives of the
Philosophers, trans. R. D. Hicks, in the Loeb series (2
volumes, 1925).13
For Stoicism under the empire, the most important sources
==>> Page 68
are the works of Seneca the Younger and Epictetus. The best
introduction to Seneca is probably the Letters to Lucilius, of
which a selection is available in Letters from a Stoic, trans.
R. Campbell (New York: Penguin, 1969). Epictetus’s
Discourses and the Encheiridion are available in the Loeb
series in a translation by W. A. Oldfather (2 volumes, 1925).
T h e Encheiridion has also been translated by T. W.
Higginson (Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1955).
For the Meditations itself the indispensable resource
(though long out of print and difficult to obtain) is A.S.L.
Farquharson’s The Meditations of the Emperor Marcus
Antoninus, 2 vols. (Oxford, Eng.: Oxford University Press,
1944). I have derived benefit from a number of earlier
English translations, notably those of Farquharson (recently
reprinted with a new introduction by R. B. Rutherford);
George Long (1862); C. R. Haines (Loeb, 1916); G.M.A.
Grube (Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1963) and Maxwell
Staniforth (New York: Penguin, 1964), as well as from W.
Theiler’s German translation (Zurich: Artemis, 1951) and the
French edition of Book 1 by Pierre Hadot (Paris: Les Belles
Lettres, 1998). The best modern edition of the Greek text is
that by J. Dalfen (2d ed., B. G. Teubner, 1987), though in
vexed passages I have sometimes preferred different
readings.
Among scholarly studies of the Meditations, three in
particular deserve mention. P. A. Brunt, “Marcus Aurelius in
==>> Page 69
His Meditations,” Journal of Roman Studies 64 (1974): 1–
20, analyzes the themes that especially exercise Marcus.
Pierre Hadot, The Inner Citadel: The “Meditations” of
Marcus Aurelius, trans. M. Chase (Cambridge, Mass.:
Harvard 
University 
Press, 
1998), 
is 
a 
thoughtful
reconstruction of Marcus’s philosophical system. R. B.
Rutherford, The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius: A Study
(Oxford, Eng.: Clarendon, 1989), is an excellent analysis
from a more literary perspective, with good remarks also on
Marcus’s relationship with the gods. Among the many
appreciations by nonclassicists two deserve special mention:
Matthew Arnold’s “Marcus Aurelius” (originally a review
of Long’s translation) in his Lectures and Essays in
Criticism, ed. R. H. Super (Ann Arbor: University of
Michigan Press, 1962), and Joseph Brodsky’s “Homage to
Marcus Aurelius” in his collection On Grief and Reason
(New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1995).

Karen Schwabach read through an initial draft of the
translation and suggested numerous improvements, for which
I am deeply grateful. For help of various sorts I am also
indebted to Deborah DeMania, Gregory Gelburd, Krista
Kane, Charles Mathewes, Katherine Odell, Hayden
Pelliccia, Ellyn Schumacher, and Alphonse Vinh. My
colleagues in the Department of Classics at the University of

Virginia, and in particular my department chair, John Miller,
made it possible for me to take course relief during the fall
semester of 2001, when much of the work was completed.
Thanks are due finally to my editor, Will Murphy, for his
patience and enthusiasm for this project.
INTRODUCTION NOTES
1. In this larger sense, rather than attempting to translate it, I
have generally left it simply as “(the) logos.” I hope that
readers who have assimilated such terms as “karma” and
“the Tao” will be prepared to welcome this one too.
2. So, too, some modern physicists have imagined a series of
universes produced by an alternation of expansions and
contractions—“big bangs” and “big crunches.”
3. Ramsay Macmullen, Enemies of the Roman Order
(Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1966), p.
48.
4. Earlier translators have been driven to clumsy equivalents
such as “Guiding Reason.” I have generally rendered it
“mind,” as being perhaps the least unsatisfactory English
equivalent.
5. Two examples are worth pointing to. Marcus finds the
==>> Page 71
gladiatorial combat and the brutal executions of the arena
a source of tedium (6.46); that they might be morally
wrong seems never to have occurred to him. He prides
himself on not having taken sexual advantage of his slaves,
not because it would have been harmful or unjust to them,
but because such self-indulgence would have been
damaging to his own character (1.17). There is no sign that
he ever questioned slavery as an institution. If asked, he
would no doubt have responded that “true” slavery is the
self-enslavement of the mind to emotion and desire (cf.
8.3, 9.40, 11.30); actual bodily slavery is merely a
condition to be accepted and endured, like nearsightedness
or a cold.
6. A still better title might be “Memoranda,” which suggests
both the miscellaneous character of the work and
something about its intended function. Scores of entries
begin with the injunctions to “remember . . .” or “keep in
mind . . . ,” while the syntax of others (e.g., 12.18)
presupposes such an admonition.
7. In order to stress the self-directed nature of the
Meditations I have sometimes preferred to translate these
as resolutions (“to . . .”) rather than direct commands.
8. The conventional divisions and numbering go back only to
the Latin translation published by Thomas Gataker in
1652. It cannot be regarded as authoritative, and I have
==>> Page 72
occasionally split up a single entry into two (sometimes
following earlier editors, sometimes not).
9. There are some striking omissions, which may or may not
be significant. Antoninus’s predecessor, Hadrian, is not
mentioned, for example. It may be that Marcus
disapproved of him, or simply that he had little contact
with him before his death in 138. Perhaps more surprising
is the lack of any reference to Herodes Atticus, from
whom Marcus learned Greek rhetoric. Does this point to
personal tensions that arose between the two in later
years? Or does the omission stem from Marcus’s move
away from rhetoric toward philosophy? (It is noteworthy
that the Latin rhetorician Fronto, with whom Marcus seems
to have been close, is allotted only a very brief entry in
comparison with Marcus’s philosophical preceptors.)
10. The openings of Books 2 and 3 differ from those that
follow in including a brief note to identify (presumably)
the place of composition. We do not know whether these
notes go back to Marcus himself, or why the other books
lack them. The average length of the entries in these two
books is perhaps slightly longer than in the later books, but
there are few differences otherwise. Attempts to find a
thematic thread within Books 2 and 3 as a whole are not
convincing.
11. I have noted the most egregious instances in the notes,
==>> Page 73
and have marked with an obelus (< . . . >) a few passages
where the original is impossible to reconstruct.
12. William Alexander Percy, Lanterns on the Levee (Baton
Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1973), p. 313.
13. A survey of work on the predecessors and rivals of the
Stoics is obviously beyond the scope of this note, but two
good starting points may be mentioned. The surviving
fragments of Heraclitus and other early philosophers who
appear in the Meditations are translated in Kathleen
Freeman, Ancilla to the Presocratic Philosophers
(Oxford: Blackwell, 1948 and later reprints). Any reader
unfamiliar with Plato should probably begin with the
Apology of Socrates, available in the Modern Library’s
Selected Dialogues of Plato, trans. B. Jowett, rev. H.
Pelliccia (New York: Random House, 2000) or any
number of other translations.

1. MY GRANDFATHER VERUS
Character and self-control.
2. MY FATHER (FROM MY OWN MEMORIES AND HIS
REPUTATIONf)
Integrity and manliness.
3. MY MOTHER
Her reverence for the divine, her generosity, her inability not
only to do wrong but even to conceive of doing it. And the
simple way she lived—not in the least like the rich.
==>> Page 76
4. MY GREAT-GRANDFATHER
To avoid the public schools, to hire good private teachers,
and to accept the resulting costs as money well-spent.
5. MY FIRST TEACHER
Not to support this side or that in chariot-racing, this fighter
or that in the games. To put up with discomfort and not make
demands. To do my own work, mind my own business, and
have no time for slanderers.
6. DIOGNETUS
Not to waste time on nonsense. Not to be taken in by
conjurors and hoodoo artists with their talk about
incantations and exorcism and all the rest of it. Not to be
obsessed with quail-fighting or other crazes like that. To hear
unwelcome truths. To practice philosophy, and to study with
Baccheius, and then with Tandasis and Marcianus. To write
dialogues as a student. To choose the Greek lifestyle—the
camp-bed and the cloak.
==>> Page 77
7. RUSTICUS
The recognition that I needed to train and discipline my
character.
Not to be sidetracked by my interest in rhetoric. Not to
write treatises on abstract questions, or deliver moralizing
little sermons, or compose imaginary descriptions of The
Simple Life or The Man Who Lives Only for Others. To steer
clear of oratory, poetry and belles lettres.
Not to dress up just to stroll around the house, or things
like that. To write straightforward letters (like the one he
sent my mother from Sinuessa). And to behave in a
conciliatory way when people who have angered or annoyed
us want to make up.
To read attentively—not to be satisfied with “just getting
the gist of it.” And not to fall for every smooth talker.
And for introducing me to Epictetus’s lectures—and
loaning me his own copy.
8. APOLLONIUS
Independence and unvarying reliability, and to pay attention
to nothing, no matter how fleetingly, except the logos. And to
==>> Page 78
be the same in all circumstances—intense pain, the loss of a
child, chronic illness. And to see clearly, from his example,
that a man can show both strength and flexibility.
His patience in teaching. And to have seen someone who
clearly viewed his expertise and ability as a teacher as the
humblest of virtues.
And to have learned how to accept favors from friends
without losing your self-respect or appearing ungrateful.
9. SEXTUS
Kindness.
An example of fatherly authority in the home. What it
means to live as nature requires.
Gravity without airs.
To show intuitive sympathy for friends, tolerance to
amateurs and sloppy thinkers. His ability to get along with
everyone: sharing his company was the highest of
compliments, and the opportunity an honor for those around
him.
To investigate and analyze, with understanding and logic,
==>> Page 79
the principles we ought to live by.
Not to display anger or other emotions. To be free of
passion and yet full of love.
To praise without bombast; to display expertise without
pretension.
10. THE LITERARY CRITIC ALEXANDER
Not to be constantly correcting people, and in particular not
to jump on them whenever they make an error of usage or a
grammatical mistake or mispronounce something, but just
answer their question or add another example, or debate the
issue itself (not their phrasing), or make some other
contribution to the discussion—and insert the right
expression, unobtrusively.
11. FRONTO
To recognize the malice, cunning, and hypocrisy that power
produces, and the peculiar ruthlessness often shown by
people from “good families.”
==>> Page 80
12. ALEXANDER THE PLATONIST
Not to be constantly telling people (or writing them) that I’m
too busy, unless I really am. Similarly, not to be always
ducking my responsibilities to the people around me because
of “pressing business.”
13. CATULUS
Not to shrug off a friend’s resentment—even unjustified
resentment—but try to put things right.
To show your teachers ungrudging respect (the Domitius
and Athenodotus story), and your children unfeigned love.
14. [MY BROTHER] SEVERUS
To love my family, truth and justice. It was through him that I
encountered Thrasea, Helvidius, Cato, Dion and Brutus, and
conceived of a society of equal laws, governed by equality
of status and of speech, and of rulers who respect the liberty
of their subjects above all else.
And from him as well, to be steady and consistent in
valuing philosophy.
==>> Page 81
And to help others and be eager to share, not to be a
pessimist, and never to doubt your friends’ affection for you.
And that when people incurred his disapproval, they always
knew it. And that his friends never had to speculate about his
attitude to anything: it was always clear.
15. MAXIMUSMaximus
Self-control and resistance to distractions.
Optimism in adversity—especially illness.
A personality in balance: dignity and grace together.
Doing your job without whining.
Other people’s certainty that what he said was what he
thought, and what he did was done without malice.
Never taken aback or apprehensive. Neither rash nor
hesitant—or bewildered, or at a loss. Not obsequious
—but not aggressive or paranoid either.
Generosity, charity, honesty.
==>> Page 82
The sense he gave of staying on the path rather than
being kept on it.
That no one could ever have felt patronized by him—or
in a position to patronize him.
A sense of humor.
16. MY ADOPTED FATHER
Compassion. Unwavering adherence to decisions, once he’d
reached them. Indifference to superficial honors. Hard work.
Persistence.
Listening to anyone who could contribute to the public
good.
His dogged determination to treat people as they deserved.
A sense of when to push and when to back off.
Putting a stop to the pursuit of boys.
His altruism. Not expecting his friends to keep him
entertained at dinner or to travel with him (unless they
wanted to). And anyone who had to stay behind to take care
of something always found him the same when he returned.
==>> Page 83
His searching questions at meetings. A kind of single-
mindedness, almost, never content with first impressions, or
breaking off the discussion prematurely.
His constancy to friends—never getting fed up with them,
or playing favorites.
Self-reliance, always. And cheerfulness.
And his advance planning (well in advance) and his
discreet attention to even minor things.
His restrictions on acclamations—and all attempts to
flatter him.
His constant devotion to the empire’s needs. His
stewardship of the treasury. His willingness to take
responsibility—and blame—for both.
His attitude to the gods: no superstitiousness. And his
attitude to men: no demagoguery, no currying favor, no
pandering. Always sober, always steady, and never vulgar or
a prey to fads.
The way he handled the material comforts that fortune had
supplied him in such abundance—without arrogance and
without apology. If they were there, he took advantage of
them. If not, he didn’t miss them.
==>> Page 84
No one ever called him glib, or shameless, or pedantic.
They saw him for what he was: a man tested by life,
accomplished, unswayed by flattery, qualified to govern both
himself and them.
His respect for people who practiced philosophy—at
least, those who were sincere about it. But without
denigrating the others—or listening to them.
His ability to feel at ease with people—and put them at
their ease, without being pushy.
His willingness to take adequate care of himself. Not a
hypochondriac or obsessed with his appearance, but not
ignoring things either. With the result that he hardly ever
needed medical attention, or drugs or any sort of salve or
ointment.
This, in particular: his willingness to yield the floor to
experts—in oratory, law, psychology, whatever—and to
support them energetically, so that each of them could fulfill
his potential.
That he respected tradition without needing to constantly
congratulate himself for Safeguarding Our Traditional
Values.
Not prone to go off on tangents, or pulled in all directions,
==>> Page 85
but sticking with the same old places and the same old things.
The way he could have one of his migraines and then go
right back to what he was doing—fresh and at the top of his
game.
That he had so few secrets—only state secrets, in fact, and
not all that many of those.
The way he kept public actions within reasonable bounds
—games, building projects, distributions of money and so on
—because he looked to what needed doing and not the credit
to be gained from doing it.
No bathing at strange hours, no self-indulgent building
projects, no concern for food, or the cut and color of his
clothes, or having attractive slaves. (The robe from his farm
at Lorium, most of the things at Lanuvium, the way he
accepted the customs agent’s apology at Tusculum, etc.)
He never exhibited rudeness, lost control of himself, or
turned violent. No one ever saw him sweat. Everything was
to be approached logically and with due consideration, in a
calm and orderly fashion but decisively, and with no loose
ends.
You could have said of him (as they say of Socrates) that
he knew how to enjoy and abstain from things that most
==>> Page 86
people find it hard to abstain from and all too easy to enjoy.
Strength, perseverance, self-control in both areas: the mark
of a soul in readiness—indomitable.
(Maximus’s illness.)
17. THE GODS
That I had good grandparents, a good mother and father, a
good sister, good teachers, good servants, relatives, friends
—almost without exception. And that I never lost control of
myself with any of them, although I had it in me to do that,
and I might have, easily. But thanks to the gods, I was never
put in that position, and so escaped the test.
That I wasn’t raised by my grandfather’s girlfriend for
longer than I was. That I didn’t lose my virginity too early,
and didn’t enter adulthood until it was time—put it off, even.
That I had someone—as a ruler and as a father—who
could keep me from being arrogant and make me realize that
even at court you can live without a troop of bodyguards, and
gorgeous clothes, lamps, sculpture—the whole charade. That
you can behave almost like an ordinary person without
seeming slovenly or careless as a ruler or when carrying out
official obligations.
==>> Page 87
That I had the kind of brother I did. One whose character
challenged me to improve my own. One whose love and
affection enriched my life.
That my children weren’t born stupid or physically
deformed.
That I wasn’t more talented in rhetoric or poetry, or other
areas. If I’d felt that I was making better progress I might
never have given them up.
That I conferred on the people who brought me up the
honors they seemed to want early on, instead of putting them
off (since they were still young) with the hope that I’d do it
later.
That I knew Apollonius, and Rusticus, and Maximus.
That I was shown clearly and often what it would be like
to live as nature requires. The gods did all they could—
through their gifts, their help, their inspiration—to ensure that
I could live as nature demands. And if I’ve failed, it’s no
one’s fault but mine. Because I didn’t pay attention to what
they told me—to what they taught me, practically, step by
step.
That my body has held out, especially considering the life
I’ve led.
==>> Page 88
That I never laid a finger on Benedicta or on Theodotus.
And that even later, when I was overcome by passion, I
recovered from it.
That even though I was often upset with Rusticus I never
did anything I would have regretted later.
That even though she died young, at least my mother spent
her last years with me.
That whenever I felt like helping someone who was short
of money, or otherwise in need, I never had to be told that I
had no resources to do it with. And that I was never put in
that position myself—of having to take something from
someone else.
That I have the wife I do: obedient, loving, humble.
That my children had competent teachers.
Remedies granted through dreams—when I was coughing
blood, for instance, and having fits of dizziness. And the one
at Caieta.
That when I became interested in philosophy I didn’t fall
into the hands of charlatans, and didn’t get bogged down in
writing treatises, or become absorbed by logic-chopping, or
preoccupied with physics.

gods.”

Book 2
ON THE RIVER GRAN, AMONG THE QUADI
==>> Page 91
 
1. When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The
people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful,
arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly. They are like this
because they can’t tell good from evil. But I have seen the
beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized
that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own—not of
the same blood or birth, but the same mind, and possessing a
share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me. No one
can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my
relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like
feet, hands, and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and
lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at
someone, to turn your back on him: these are obstructions.
2. Whatever this is that I am, it is flesh and a little spirit and
an intelligence. Throw away your books; stop letting yourself
be distracted. That is not allowed. Instead, as if you were
dying right now, despise your flesh. A mess of blood, pieces
of bone, a woven tangle of nerves, veins, arteries. Consider
what the spirit is: air, and never the same air, but vomited out
==>> Page 92
and gulped in again every instant. Finally, the intelligence.
Think of it this way: You are an old man. Stop allowing your
mind to be a slave, to be jerked about by selfish impulses, to
kick against fate and the present, and to mistrust the future.
3. What is divine is full of Providence. Even chance is not
divorced from nature, from the inweaving and enfolding of
things governed by Providence. Everything proceeds from it.
And then there is necessity and the needs of the whole world,
of which you are a part. Whatever the nature of the whole
does, and whatever serves to maintain it, is good for every
part of nature. The world is maintained by change—in the
elements and in the things they compose. That should be
enough for you; treat it as an axiom. Discard your thirst for
books, so that you won’t die in bitterness, but in cheerfulness
and truth, grateful to the gods from the bottom of your heart.
4. Remember how long you’ve been putting this off, how
many extensions the gods gave you, and you didn’t use them.
At some point you have to recognize what world it is that you
belong to; what power rules it and from what source you
spring; that there is a limit to the time assigned you, and if
you don’t use it to free yourself it will be gone and will
never return.
5. Concentrate every minute like a Roman—like a man—on
doing what’s in front of you with precise and genuine
seriousness, tenderly, willingly, with justice. And on freeing
==>> Page 93
yourself from all other distractions. Yes, you can—if you do
everything as if it were the last thing you were doing in your
life, and stop being aimless, stop letting your emotions
override what your mind tells you, stop being hypocritical,
self-centered, irritable. You see how few things you have to
do to live a satisfying and reverent life? If you can manage
this, that’s all even the gods can ask of you.
6. Yes, keep on degrading yourself, soul. But soon your
chance at dignity will be gone. Everyone gets one life. Yours
is almost used up, and instead of treating yourself with
respect, you have entrusted your own happiness to the souls
of others.
7. Do external things distract you? Then make time for
yourself to learn something worthwhile; stop letting yourself
be pulled in all directions. But make sure you guard against
the other kind of confusion. People who labor all their lives
but have no purpose to direct every thought and impulse
toward are wasting their time—even when hard at work.
8. Ignoring what goes on in other people’s souls—no one
ever came to grief that way. But if you won’t keep track of
what your own soul’s doing, how can you not be unhappy?
9. Don’t ever forget these things:
==>> Page 94
The nature of the world.
My nature.
How I relate to the world.
What proportion of it I make up.
That you are part of nature, and no one can prevent you
from speaking and acting in harmony with it, always.
10. In comparing sins (the way people do) Theophrastus says
that the ones committed out of desire are worse than the ones
committed out of anger: which is good philosophy. The angry
man seems to turn his back on reason out of a kind of pain
and inner convulsion. But the man motivated by desire, who
is mastered by pleasure, seems somehow more self-
indulgent, less manly in his sins. Theophrastus is right, and
philosophically sound, to say that the sin committed out of
pleasure deserves a harsher rebuke than the one committed
out of pain. The angry man is more like a victim of
wrongdoing, provoked by pain to anger. The other man
rushes into wrongdoing on his own, moved to action by
desire.
11. You could leave life right now. Let that determine what
you do and say and think. If the gods exist, then to abandon
human beings is not frightening; the gods would never subject
==>> Page 95
you to harm. And if they don’t exist, or don’t care what
happens to us, what would be the point of living in a world
without gods or Providence? But they do exist, they do care
what happens to us, and everything a person needs to avoid
real harm they have placed within him. If there were anything
harmful on the other side of death, they would have made
sure that the ability to avoid it was within you. If it doesn’t
harm your character, how can it harm your life? Nature
would not have overlooked such dangers through failing to
recognize them, or because it saw them but was powerless to
prevent or correct them. Nor would it ever, through inability
or incompetence, make such a mistake as to let good and bad
things happen indiscriminately to good and bad alike. But
death and life, success and failure, pain and pleasure, wealth
and poverty, all these happen to good and bad alike, and they
are neither noble nor shameful—and hence neither good nor
bad.
12. The speed with which all of them vanish—the objects in
the world, and the memory of them in time. And the real
nature of the things our senses experience, especially those
that entice us with pleasure or frighten us with pain or are
loudly trumpeted by pride. To understand those things—how
stupid, contemptible, grimy, decaying, and dead they are—
that’s what our intellectual powers are for. And to
understand what those people really amount to, whose
opinions and voices constitute fame. And what dying is—and
that if you look at it in the abstract and break down your
==>> Page 96
imaginary ideas of it by logical analysis, you realize that it’s
nothing but a process of nature, which only children can be
afraid of. (And not only a process of nature but a necessary
one.) And how man grasps God, with what part of himself he
does so, and how that part is conditioned when he does.
13. Nothing is more pathetic than people who run around in
circles, “delving into the things that lie beneath” and
conducting investigations into the souls of the people around
them, never realizing that all you have to do is to be attentive
to the power inside you and worship it sincerely. To worship
it is to keep it from being muddied with turmoil and
becoming aimless and dissatisfied with nature—divine and
human. What is divine deserves our respect because it is
good; what is human deserves our affection because it is like
us. And our pity too, sometimes, for its inability to tell good
from bad—as terrible a blindness as the kind that can’t tell
white from black.
14. Even if you’re going to live three thousand more years, or
ten times that, remember: you cannot lose another life than
the one you’re living now, or live another one than the one
you’re losing. The longest amounts to the same as the
shortest. The present is the same for everyone; its loss is the
same for everyone; and it should be clear that a brief instant
is all that is lost. For you can’t lose either the past or the
future; how could you lose what you don’t have?
==>> Page 97
Remember two things:
i. that everything has always been the same, and keeps
recurring, and it makes no difference whether you see
the same things recur in a hundred years or two hundred,
or in an infinite period;
ii. that the longest-lived and those who will die soonest
lose the same thing. The present is all that they can give
up, since that is all you have, and what you do not have,
you cannot lose.
15. “Everything is just an impression.” —Monimus the
Cynic. And the response is obvious enough. But the point is a
useful one, if you take it for what it’s worth.
16. The human soul degrades itself:
i. Above all, when it does its best to become an
abscess, a kind of detached growth on the world. To be
disgruntled at anything that happens is a kind of
secession from Nature, which comprises the nature of
all things.
ii. When it turns its back on another person or sets out to
==>> Page 98
do it harm, as the souls of the angry do.
iii. When it is overpowered by pleasure or pain.
iv. When it puts on a mask and does or says something
artificial or false.
v. When it allows its action and impulse to be without a
purpose, to be random and disconnected: even the
smallest things ought to be directed toward a goal. But
the goal of rational beings is to follow the rule and law
of the most ancient of communities and states.
17. Human life.
Duration: momentary. Nature: changeable. Perception:
dim. Condition of Body: decaying. Soul: spinning around.
Fortune: unpredictable. Lasting Fame: uncertain. Sum Up:
The body and its parts are a river, the soul a dream and
mist, life is warfare and a journey far from home, lasting
reputation is oblivion.
Then what can guide us?
Only philosophy.
Which means making sure that the power within stays safe
and free from assault, superior to pleasure and pain, doing
nothing randomly or dishonestly and with imposture, not
==>> Page 99
dependent on anyone else’s doing something or not doing it.
And making sure that it accepts what happens and what it is
dealt as coming from the same place it came from. And
above all, that it accepts death in a cheerful spirit, as nothing
but the dissolution of the elements from which each living
thing is composed. If it doesn’t hurt the individual elements
to change continually into one another, why are people afraid
of all of them changing and separating? It’s a natural thing.
And nothing natural is evil.
==>> Page 100
 
Book 3
IN CARNUNTUM
==>> Page 101
products of the baking, and yet pleasing, somehow: they
rouse our appetite without our knowing why.
Or how ripe figs begin to burst.
And olives on the point of falling: the shadow of decay
gives them a peculiar beauty.
Stalks of wheat bending under their own weight. The
furrowed brow of the lion. Flecks of foam on the boar’s
mouth.
And other things. If you look at them in isolation there’s
nothing beautiful about them, and yet by supplementing nature
they enrich it and draw us in. And anyone with a feeling for
nature—a deeper sensitivity—will find it all gives pleasure.
Even what seems inadvertent. He’ll find the jaws of live
animals as beautiful as painted ones or sculptures. He’ll look
calmly at the distinct beauty of old age in men, women, and at
the loveliness of children. And other things like that will call
out to him constantly—things unnoticed by others. Things
seen only by those at home with Nature and its works.
3. Hippocrates cured many illnesses—and then fell ill and
died. The Chaldaeans predicted the deaths of many others; in
due course their own hour arrived. Alexander, Pompey,
Caesar—who utterly destroyed so many cities, cut down so
many thousand foot and horse in battle—they too departed
==>> Page 102
this life. Heraclitus often told us the world would end in fire.
But it was moisture that carried him off; he died smeared
with cowshit. Democritus was killed by ordinary vermin,
Socrates by the human kind.
And?
You boarded, you set sail, you’ve made the passage. Time
to disembark. If it’s for another life, well, there’s nowhere
without gods on that side either. If to nothingness, then you no
longer have to put up with pain and pleasure, or go on
dancing attendance on this battered crate, your body—so
much inferior to that which serves it.
One is mind and spirit, the other earth and garbage.
4. Don’t waste the rest of your time here worrying about
other people—unless it affects the common good. It will
keep you from doing anything useful. You’ll be too
preoccupied with what so-and-so is doing, and why, and
what they’re saying, and what they’re thinking, and what
they’re up to, and all the other things that throw you off and
keep you from focusing on your own mind.
You need to avoid certain things in your train of thought:
everything random, everything irrelevant. And certainly
everything self-important or malicious. You need to get used
to winnowing your thoughts, so that if someone says, “What
==>> Page 103
Which doesn’t mean we have to share their opinions. We
should listen only to those whose lives conform to nature.
And the others? He bears in mind what sort of people they
are—both at home and abroad, by night as well as day—and
who they spend their time with. And he cares nothing for
their praise—men who can’t even meet their own standards.
5. How to act:
Never under compulsion, out of selfishness, without
forethought, with misgivings.
Don’t gussy up your thoughts.
No surplus words or unnecessary actions.
Let the spirit in you represent a man, an adult, a citizen,
a Roman, a ruler. Taking up his post like a soldier
and patiently awaiting his recall from life. Needing
no oath or witness.
Cheerfulness. Without requiring other people’s help. Or
serenity supplied by others.
To stand up straight—not straightened.
6. If, at some point in your life, you should come across
==>> Page 104
anything better than justice, honesty, self-control, courage—
than a mind satisfied that it has succeeded in enabling you to
act rationally, and satisfied to accept what’s beyond its
control—if you find anything better than that, embrace it
without reservations—it must be an extraordinary thing
indeed—and enjoy it to the full.
But if nothing presents itself that’s superior to the spirit
that lives within—the one that has subordinated individual
desires to itself, that discriminates among impressions, that
has broken free of physical temptations (as Socrates used to
say), and subordinated itself to the gods, and looks out for
human beings’ welfare—if you find that there’s nothing more
important or valuable than that . . .
. . . then don’t make room for anything but it—for anything
that might lead you astray, tempt you off the road, and leave
you unable to devote yourself completely to achieving the
goodness that is uniquely yours. It would be wrong for
anything to stand between you and attaining goodness—as a
rational being and a citizen. Anything at all: the applause of
the crowd, high office, wealth, or self-indulgence. All of
them might seem to be compatible with it—for a while. But
suddenly they control us and sweep us away.
So make your choice straightforwardly, once and for all,
and stick to it. Choose what’s best.
==>> Page 105
Neither servility nor arrogance. Neither cringing nor
disdain. Neither excuses nor evasions.
9. Your ability to control your thoughts—treat it with respect.
It’s all that protects your mind from false perceptions—false
to your nature, and that of all rational beings. It’s what makes
thoughtfulness possible, and affection for other people, and
submission to the divine.
10. Forget everything else. Keep hold of this alone and
remember it: Each of us lives only now, this brief instant.
The rest has been lived already, or is impossible to see. The
span we live is small—small as the corner of the earth in
which we live it. Small as even the greatest renown, passed
from mouth to mouth by short-lived stick figures, ignorant
alike of themselves and those long dead.
11. To the stand-bys above, add this one: always to define
whatever it is we perceive—to trace its outline—so we can
see what it really is: its substance. Stripped bare. As a
whole. Unmodified. And to call it by its name—the thing
itself and its components, to which it will eventually return.
Nothing is so conducive to spiritual growth as this capacity
for logical and accurate analysis of everything that happens
to us. To look at it in such a way that we understand what
need it fulfills, and in what kind of world. And its value to
that world as a whole and to man in particular—as a citizen
of that higher city, of which all other cities are mere
==>> Page 106
households.
What is it—this thing that now forces itself on my notice?
What is it made up of? How long was it designed to last?
And what qualities do I need to bring to bear on it—
tranquillity, 
courage, 
honesty, 
trustworthiness,
straightforwardness, independence or what?
So in each case you need to say: “This is due to God.” Or:
“This is due to the interweavings and intertwinings of fate, to
coincidence or chance.” Or: “This is due to a human being.
Someone of the same race, the same birth, the same society,
but who doesn’t know what nature requires of him. But I do.
And so I’ll treat them as the law that binds us—the law of
nature—requires. With kindness and with justice.
And in inconsequential things? I’ll do my best to treat them
as they deserve.”
12. If you do the job in a principled way, with diligence,
energy and patience, if you keep yourself free of distractions,
and keep the spirit inside you undamaged, as if you might
have to give it back at any moment—
If you can embrace this without fear or expectation—can
find fulfillment in what you’re doing now, as Nature
intended, and in superhuman truthfulness (every word, every
utterance)—then your life will be happy.
==>> Page 107
rutting humans, and tyrants (from Phalaris to Nero . . .).
To make your mind your guide to what seems best: even
people who deny the gods do that. Even people who betray
their country. Even people who do <. . .> behind closed
doors.
If all the rest is common coin, then what is unique to the
good man?
To welcome with affection what is sent by fate. Not to
stain or disturb the spirit within him with a mess of false
beliefs. Instead, to preserve it faithfully, by calmly obeying
God—saying nothing untrue, doing nothing unjust. And if the
others don’t acknowledge it—this life lived with simplicity,
humility, cheerfulness—he doesn’t resent them for it, and
isn’t deterred from following the road where it leads: to the
end of life. An end to be approached in purity, in serenity, in
acceptance, in peaceful unity with what must be.

harmony.
So keep getting away from it all—like that. Renew
yourself. But keep it brief and basic. A quick visit should be
enough to ward off all < . . . > and send you back ready to
face what awaits you.
What’s there to complain about? People’s misbehavior?
But take into consideration:
• that rational beings exist for one another;
• that doing what’s right sometimes requires patience;
• that no one does the wrong thing deliberately;
• and the number of people who have feuded and envied
and hated and fought and died and been buried.
. . . and keep your mouth shut.
Or are you complaining about the things the world assigns
you? But consider the two options: Providence or atoms.
And all the arguments for seeing the world as a city.
==>> Page 110
Or is it your body? Keep in mind that when the mind
detaches itself and realizes its own nature, it no longer has
anything to do with ordinary life—the rough and the smooth,
either one. And remember all you’ve been taught—and
accepted—about pain and pleasure.
Or is it your reputation that’s bothering you? But look at
how soon we’re all forgotten. The abyss of endless time that
swallows it all. The emptiness of all those applauding hands.
The people who praise us—how capricious they are, how
arbitrary. And the tiny region in which it all takes place. The
whole earth a point in space—and most of it uninhabited.
How many people there will be to admire you, and who they
are.
So keep this refuge in mind: the back roads of your self.
Above all, no strain and no stress. Be straightforward. Look
at things like a man, like a human being, like a citizen, like a
mortal. And among the things you turn to, these two:
i. That things have no hold on the soul. They stand there
unmoving, outside it. Disturbance comes only from
within—from our own perceptions.
ii. That everything you see will soon alter and cease to
exist. Think of how many changes you’ve already seen.
==>> Page 111
Not an embarrassing thing. Not an offense to reason, or our
nature.
6. That sort of person is bound to do that. You might as well
resent a fig tree for secreting juice. (Anyway, before very
long you’ll both be dead—dead and soon forgotten.)
7. Choose not to be harmed—and you won’t feel harmed.
Don’t feel harmed—and you haven’t been.
8. It can ruin your life only if it ruins your character.
Otherwise it cannot harm you—inside or out.
9. It was for the best. So Nature had no choice but to do it.
10. That every event is the right one. Look closely and you’ll
see.
Not just the right one overall, but right. As if someone had
weighed it out with scales.
Keep looking closely like that, and embody it in your
actions: goodness—what defines a good person.
Keep to it in everything you do.
11. Not what your enemy sees and hopes that you will, but
what’s really there.
==>> Page 112
12. Two kinds of readiness are constantly needed: (i) to do
only what the logos of authority and law directs, with the
good of human beings in mind; (ii) to reconsider your
position, when someone can set you straight or convert you to
his. But your conversion should always rest on a conviction
that it’s right, or benefits others—nothing else. Not because
it’s more appealing or more popular.
13. You have a mind?
—Yes.
Well, why not use it? Isn’t that all you want—for it to do
its job?
14. You have functioned as a part of something; you will
vanish into what produced you.
Or be restored, rather.
To the logos from which all things spring.
By being changed.
15. Many lumps of incense on the same altar. One crumbles
now, one later, but it makes no difference.
16. Now they see you as a beast, a monkey. But in a week
they’ll think you’re a god—if you rediscover your beliefs
==>> Page 113
and sufficient to themselves. Praise is extraneous. The object
of praise remains what it was—no better and no worse. This
applies, I think, even to “beautiful” things in ordinary life—
physical objects, artworks.
Does anything genuinely beautiful need supplementing? No
more than justice does—or truth, or kindness, or humility.
Are any of those improved by being praised? Or damaged by
contempt? Is an emerald suddenly flawed if no one admires
it? Or gold, or ivory, or purple? Lyres? Knives? Flowers?
Bushes?
21. If our souls survive, how does the air find room for them
—all of them—since the beginning of time?
How does the earth find room for all the bodies buried in
it since the beginning of time? They linger for whatever
length of time, and then, through change and decomposition,
make room for others. So too with the souls that inhabit the
air. They linger a little, and then are changed—diffused and
kindled into fire, absorbed into the logos from which all
things spring, and so make room for new arrivals.
One possible answer.
But we shouldn’t think only of the mass of buried bodies.
There are the ones consumed, on a daily basis, by us and by
other animals. How many are swallowed up like that,
==>> Page 114
entombed in the bodies of those nourished by them, and yet
there is room for them all—converted into flesh and blood,
transformed to air and fire.
How is the truth of this determined?
Through analysis: material and cause.
22. Not to be driven this way and that, but always to behave
with justice and see things as they are.
23. To the world: Your harmony is mine. Whatever time you
choose is the right time. Not late, not early.
To nature: What the turn of your seasons brings me falls
like ripe fruit. All things are born from you, exist in you,
return to you.
The poet says “dear city of Cecrops . . .” Can’t you bring
yourself to say “of Zeus”?
24. “If you seek tranquillity, do less.” Or (more accurately)
do what’s essential—what the logos of a social being
requires, and in the requisite way. Which brings a double
satisfaction: to do less, better.
Because most of what we say and do is not essential. If
you can eliminate it, you’ll have more time, and more
tranquillity. Ask yourself at every moment, “Is this
==>> Page 115
29. Alien: (n.) one who doesn’t know what the world
contains. Or how it operates.
Fugitive: (n.) one who evades his obligations to others.
Blind: (adj.) one who keeps the eyes of his mind shut tight.
Poor: (adj.) requiring others; not having the necessities of
life in one’s own possession.
Rebel: (n.) one who is rebellious, one who withdraws
from the logos of Nature because he resents its workings. (It
produced you; now it produces this.)
Schismatic: (n.) one who separates his own soul from
others with the logos. They should be one.
30. A philosopher without clothes and one without books. “I
have nothing to eat,” says he, as he stands there half-naked,
“but I subsist on the logos.” And with nothing to read, I
subsist on it too.
31. Love the discipline you know, and let it support you.
Entrust everything willingly to the gods, and then make your
way through life—no one’s master and no one’s slave.
32. The age of Vespasian, for example. People doing the
exact same things: marrying, raising children, getting sick,
dying, waging war, throwing parties, doing business,
==>> Page 116
farming, flattering, boasting, distrusting, plotting, hoping
others will die, complaining about their own lives, falling in
love, putting away money, seeking high office and power.
And that life they led is nowhere to be found.
Or the age of Trajan. The exact same things. And that life
too—gone.
Survey the records of other eras. And see how many others
gave their all and soon died and decomposed into the
elements that formed them.
But most of all, run through the list of those you knew
yourself. Those who worked in vain, who failed to do what
they should have—what they should have remained fixed on
and found satisfaction in.
A key point to bear in mind: The value of attentiveness
varies in proportion to its object. You’re better off not giving
the small things more time than they deserve.
33. Words once in common use now sound archaic. And the
names of the famous dead as well: Camillus, Caeso, Volesus,
Dentatus . . . Scipio and Cato . . . Augustus . . . Hadrian and
Antoninus, and . . .
Everything fades so quickly, turns into legend, and soon
==>> Page 117
38. Look into their minds, at what the wise do and what they
don’t.
39. Nothing that goes on in anyone else’s mind can harm you.
Nor can the shifts and changes in the world around you.
—Then where is harm to be found?
In your capacity to see it. Stop doing that and everything
will be fine. Let the part of you that makes that judgment keep
quiet even if the body it’s attached to is stabbed or burnt, or
stinking with pus, or consumed by cancer. Or to put it another
way: It needs to realize that what happens to everyone—bad
and good alike—is neither good nor bad. That what happens
in every life—lived naturally or not—is neither natural nor
unnatural.
40. The world as a living being—one nature, one soul. Keep
that in mind. And how everything feeds into that single
experience, moves with a single motion. And how everything
helps produce everything else. Spun and woven together.
41. “A little wisp of soul carrying a corpse.”—Epictetus.
42. There is nothing bad in undergoing change—or good in
emerging from it.
43. Time is a river, a violent current of events, glimpsed
==>> Page 118
once and already carried past us, and another follows and is
gone.
44. Everything that happens is as simple and familiar as the
rose in spring, the fruit in summer: disease, death,
blasphemy, conspiracy . . . everything that makes stupid
people happy or angry.
45. What follows coheres with what went before. Not like a
random catalogue whose order is imposed upon it arbitrarily,
but logically connected. And just as what exists is ordered
and harmonious, what comes into being betrays an order too.
Not a mere sequence, but an astonishing concordance.
46. Remember Heraclitus: “When earth dies, it becomes
water; water, air; air, fire; and back to the beginning.”
“Those who have forgotten where the road leads.”
“They are at odds with what is all around them”—the all-
directing logos. And “they find alien what they meet with
every day.”
“Our words and actions should not be like those of
sleepers” (for we act and speak in dreams as well) “or of
children copying their parents”—doing and saying only what
we have been told.
==>> Page 119
it upwithout complaint.
Like an olive that ripens and falls.
Praising its mother, thanking the tree it grew on.
49. To be like the rock that the waves keep crashing over. It
stands unmoved and the raging of the sea falls still around it.
49a. —It’s unfortunate that this has happened.
No. It’s fortunate that this has happened and I’ve remained
unharmed by it—not shattered by the present or frightened of
the future. It could have happened to anyone. But not
everyone could have remained unharmed by it. Why treat the
one as a misfortune rather than the other as fortunate? Can
you really call something a misfortune that doesn’t violate
human nature? Or do you think something that’s not against
nature’s will can violate it? But you know what its will is.
Does what’s happened keep you from acting with justice,
generosity, self-control, sanity, prudence, honesty, humility,
straightforwardness, and all the other qualities that allow a
person’s nature to fulfill itself?
So remember this principle when something threatens to
cause you pain: the thing itself was no misfortune at all; to
endure it and prevail is great good fortune.
==>> Page 120
50. A trite but effective tactic against the fear of death: think
of the list of people who had to be pried away from life.
What did they gain by dying old? In the end, they all sleep six
feet under—Caedicianus, Fabius, Julian, Lepidus, and all the
rest. They buried their contemporaries, and were buried in
turn.
Our lifetime is so brief. And to live it out in these
circumstances, among these people, in this body? Nothing to
get excited about. Consider the abyss of time past, the infinite
future. Three days of life or three generations: what’s the
difference?
51. Take the shortest route, the one that nature planned—to
speak and act in the healthiest way. Do that, and be free of
pain and stress, free of all calculation and pretension.
==>> Page 121
 
1. At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell
yourself: “I have to go to work—as a human being. What do I
have to complain of, if I’m going to do what I was born for—
the things I was brought into the world to do? Or is this what
I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay
warm?
—But it’s nicer here. . . .
So you were born to feel “nice”? Instead of doing things
and experiencing them? Don’t you see the plants, the birds,
the ants and spiders and bees going about their individual
tasks, putting the world in order, as best they can? And
you’re not willing to do your job as a human being? Why
aren’t you running to do what your nature demands?
—But we have to sleep sometime. . . .
Agreed. But nature set a limit on that—as it did on eating
and drinking. And you’re over the limit. You’ve had more
than enough of that. But not of working. There you’re still
==>> Page 122
below your quota.
You don’t love yourself enough. Or you’d love your nature
too, and what it demands of you. People who love what they
do wear themselves down doing it, they even forget to wash
or eat. Do you have less respect for your own nature than the
engraver does for engraving, the dancer for the dance, the
miser for money or the social climber for status? When
they’re really possessed by what they do, they’d rather stop
eating and sleeping than give up practicing their arts.
Is helping others less valuable to you? Not worth your
effort?
2.To shrug it all off and wipe it clean—every annoyance and
distraction—and reach utter stillness.
Child’s play.
3. If an action or utterance is appropriate, then it’s
appropriate for you. Don’t be put off by other people’s
comments and criticism. If it’s right to say or do it, then it’s
the right thing for you to do or say.
The others obey their own lead, follow their own
impulses. Don’t be distracted. Keep walking. Follow your
own nature, and follow Nature—along the road they share.
==>> Page 123
6. Some people, when they do someone a favor, are always
looking for a chance to call it in. And some aren’t, but
they’re still aware of it—still regard it as a debt. But others
don’t even do that. They’re like a vine that produces grapes
without looking for anything in return.
A horse at the end of the race . . .
A dog when the hunt is over . . .
A bee with its honey stored . . .
And a human being after helping others.
They don’t make a fuss about it. They just go on to
something else, as the vine looks forward to bearing fruit
again in season.
We should be like that. Acting almost unconsciously.
—Yes. Except conscious of it. Because it’s characteristic
of social beings that they see themselves as acting socially.
And expect their neighbors to see it too!
That’s true. But you’re misunderstanding me. You’ll wind
up like the people I mentioned before, misled by plausible
reasoning. But if you make an effort to understand what I’m
saying, then you won’t need to worry about neglecting your
social duty.
==>> Page 124
7. Prayer of the Athenians:
Zeus, rain down, rain down
On the land and fields of Athens.
Either no prayers at all—or one as straightforward as that.
8. Just as you overhear people saying that “the doctor
prescribed such-and-such for him” (like riding, or cold
baths, or walking barefoot . . .), say this: “Nature prescribed
illness for him.” Or blindness. Or the loss of a limb. Or
whatever. There “prescribed” means something like
“ordered, so as to further his recovery.” And so too here.
What happens to each of us is ordered. It furthers our destiny.
And when we describe things as “taking place,” we’re
talking like builders, who say that blocks in a wall or a
pyramid “take their place” in the structure, and fit together in
a harmonious pattern.
For there is a single harmony. Just as the world forms a
single body comprising all bodies, so fate forms a single
purpose, comprising all purposes. Even complete illiterates
acknowledge it when they say that something “brought on”
this or that. Brought on, yes. Or prescribed it. And in that
==>> Page 125
behaving like a human—however imperfectly—and fully
embrace the pursuit that you’ve embarked on.
And not to think of philosophy as your instructor, but as the
sponge and egg white that relieve ophthalmia—as a soothing
ointment, a warm lotion. Not showing off your obedience to
the logos, but resting in it. Remember: philosophy requires
only what your nature already demands. What you’ve been
after is something else again—something unnatural.
—But what could be preferable?
That’s exactly how pleasure traps us, isn’t it? Wouldn’t
magnanimity 
be 
preferable? 
Or 
freedom? 
Honesty?
Prudence? Piety? And is there anything preferable to thought
itself—to 
logic, 
to 
understanding? 
Think 
of 
their
surefootedness. Their fluent stillness.
10. Things are wrapped in such a veil of mystery that many
good philosophers have found it impossible to make sense of
them. Even the Stoics have trouble. Any assessment we make
is subject to alteration—just as we are ourselves.
Look closely at them—how impermanent they are, how
meaningless. Things that a pervert can own, a whore, a thief.
Then look at the way the people around you behave. Even
the best of them are hard to put up with—not to mention
==>> Page 126
putting up with yourself. In such deep darkness, such a sewer
—in the flux of material, of time, of motion and things moved
—I don’t know what there is to value or to work for.
Quite the contrary. We need to comfort ourselves and wait
for dissolution. And not get impatient in the meantime, but
take refuge in these two things:
i. Nothing can happen to me that isn’t natural.
ii. I can keep from doing anything that God and my own
spirit don’t approve. No one can force me to.
11. What am I doing with my soul?
Interrogate yourself, to find out what inhabits your so-
called mind and what kind of soul you have now. A child’s
soul, an adolescent’s, a woman’s? A tyrant’s soul? The soul
of a predator—or its prey?
12. Another way to grasp what ordinary people mean by
“goods”:
Suppose you took certain things as touchstones of
goodness: prudence, self-control, justice, and courage, say. If
==>> Page 127
recurrent cycles.
14. The logos and its employment are forces sufficient for
themselves and for their works. They start from their own
beginning, they proceed to the appointed end. We call such
activities “directed,” from the directness of their course.
15. Nothing pertains to human beings except what defines us
as human. No other things can be demanded of us. They
aren’t proper to human nature, nor is it incomplete without
them. It follows that they are not our goal, or what helps us
reach it—the good. If any of them were proper to us, it would
be improper to disdain or resist it. Nor would we admire
people who show themselves immune to it. If the things
themselves were good, it could hardly be good to give them
up. But in reality the more we deny ourselves such things
(and things like them)—or are deprived of them
involuntarily, even—the better we become.
16. The things you think about determine the quality of your
mind. Your soul takes on the color of your thoughts. Color it
with a run of thoughts like these:
i. Anywhere you can lead your life, you can lead a good
one.
==>> Page 128
—Lives are led at court. . . .
Then good ones can be.
ii. Things gravitate toward what they were intended for.
What things gravitate toward is their goal.
A thing’s goal is what benefits it—its good.
A rational being’s good is unselfishness. What we were
born for. That’s nothing new. Remember? Lower things
for the sake of higher ones, and higher ones for one
another. Things that have consciousness are higher than
those that don’t. And those with the logos still higher.
17. It is crazy to want what is impossible. And impossible
for the wicked not to do so.
18. Nothing happens to anyone that he can’t endure. The same
thing happens to other people, and they weather it unharmed
—out of sheer obliviousness or because they want to display
“character.” Is wisdom really so much weaker than
ignorance and vanity?
19. Things have no hold on the soul. They have no access to
it, cannot move or direct it. It is moved and directed by itself
==>> Page 129
community isn’t injured by it, neither am I. And if it is, anger
is not the answer. Show the offender where he went wrong.
23. Keep in mind how fast things pass by and are gone—
those that are now, and those to come. Existence flows past
us like a river: the “what” is in constant flux, the “why” has a
thousand variations. Nothing is stable, not even what’s right
here. The infinity of past and future gapes before us—a
chasm whose depths we cannot see.
So it would take an idiot to feel self-importance or
distress. Or any indignation, either. As if the things that
irritate us lasted.
24. Remember:
Matter. How tiny your share of it.
Time. How brief and fleeting your allotment of it.
Fate. How small a role you play in it.
25. So other people hurt me? That’s their problem. Their
character and actions are not mine. What is done to me is
ordained by nature, what I do by my own.
26. The mind is the ruler of the soul. It should remain
unstirred by agitations of the flesh—gentle and violent ones
alike. Not mingling with them, but fencing itself off and
==>> Page 130
keeping those feelings in their place. When they make their
way into your thoughts, through the sympathetic link between
mind and body, don’t try to resist the sensation. The
sensation is natural. But don’t let the mind start in with
judgments, calling it “good” or “bad.”
27. “To live with the gods.” And to do that is to show them
that your soul accepts what it is given and does what the
spirit requires—the spirit God gave each of us to lead and
guide us, a fragment of himself. Which is our mind, our
logos.
28. Don’t be irritated at people’s smell or bad breath.
What’s the point? With that mouth, with those armpits,
they’re going to produce that odor.
—But they have a brain! Can’t they figure it out? Can’t
they recognize the problem?
So you have a brain as well. Good for you. Then use your
logic to awaken his. Show him. Make him realize it. If he’ll
listen, then you’ll have solved the problem. Without anger.
28a. Neither player-king nor prostitute.
29. You can live here as you expect to live there.
And if they won’t let you, you can depart life now and
==>> Page 131
soul with skill and understanding?
—And which is that?
The one that knows the beginning and the end, and knows
the logos that runs through all things and that assigns to all a
place, each in its allotted span, throughout the whole of time.
33. Soon you’ll be ashes, or bones. A mere name, at most—
and even that is just a sound, an echo. The things we want in
life are empty, stale, and trivial. Dogs snarling at each other.
Quarreling children—laughing and then bursting into tears a
moment later. Trust, shame, justice, truth—“gone from the
earth and only found in heaven.”
Why are you still here? Sensory objects are shifting and
unstable; our senses dim and easily deceived; the soul itself a
decoction of the blood; fame in a world like this is
worthless.
—And so?
Wait for it patiently—annihilation or metamorphosis.
—And until that time comes—what?
Honor and revere the gods, treat human beings as they
deserve, be tolerant with others and strict with yourself.
Remember, nothing belongs to you but your flesh and blood
==>> Page 132
—and nothing else is under your control.
34. You can lead an untroubled life provided you can grow,
can think and act systematically.
Two characteristics shared by gods and men (and every
rational creature):
i. Not to let others hold you back.
ii. To locate goodness in thinking and doing the right
thing, and to limit your desires to that.
35. If:
• this evil is not of my doing,
• nor the result of it,
• and the community is not endangered, why should it
bother me?
==>> Page 133
 
Book 6
==>> Page 134
 
1. Nature is pliable, obedient. And the logos that governs it
has no reason to do evil. It knows no evil, does none, and
causes harm to nothing. It dictates all beginnings and all
endings.
2. Just that you do the right thing. The rest doesn’t matter.
Cold or warm.
Tired or well-rested.
Despised or honored.
Dying . . . or busy with other assignments.
Because dying, too, is one of our assignments in life.
There as well: “to do what needs doing.”
3. Look inward. Don’t let the true nature or value of anything
elude you.
==>> Page 135
Or suppose (ii): Reverence. Serenity. Faith in the power
responsible.
11. When jarred, unavoidably, by circumstances, revert at
once to yourself, and don’t lose the rhythm more than you can
help. You’ll have a better grasp of the harmony if you keep
on going back to it.
12. If you had a stepmother and a real mother, you would pay
your respects to your stepmother, yes . . . but it’s your real
mother you’d go home to.
The court . . . and philosophy: Keep returning to it, to rest
in its embrace. It’s all that makes the court—and you—
endurable.
13. Like seeing roasted meat and other dishes in front of you
and suddenly realizing: This is a dead fish. A dead bird. A
dead pig. Or that this noble vintage is grape juice, and the
purple robes are sheep wool dyed with shellfish blood. Or
making love—something rubbing against your penis, a brief
seizure and a little cloudy liquid.
Perceptions like that—latching onto things and piercing
through them, so we see what they really are. That’s what we
need to do all the time—all through our lives when things lay
claim to our trust—to lay them bare and see how pointless
they are, to strip away the legend that encrusts them.
==>> Page 136
Pride is a master of deception: when you think you’re
occupied in the weightiest business, that’s when he has you
in his spell.
(Compare Crates on Xenocrates.)
14. Things ordinary people are impressed by fall into the
categories of things that are held together by simple physics
(like stones or wood), or by natural growth (figs, vines,
olives . . .). Those admired by more advanced minds are held
together by a living soul (flocks of sheep, herds of cows).
Still more sophisticated people admire what is guided by a
rational mind—not the universal mind, but one admired for
its technical knowledge, or for some other skill—or just
because it happens to own a lot of slaves.
But those who revere that other mind—the one we all
share, as humans and as citizens—aren’t interested in other
things. Their focus is on the state of their own minds—to
avoid all selfishness and illogic, and to work with others to
achieve that goal.
15. Some things are rushing into existence, others out of it.
Some of what now exists is already gone. Change and flux
constantly remake the world, just as the incessant
progression of time remakes eternity.
We find ourselves in a river. Which of the things around us
==>> Page 137
Then what is to be prized?
An audience clapping? No. No more than the clacking of
their tongues. Which is all that public praise amounts to—a
clacking of tongues.
So we throw out other people’s recognition. What’s left
for us to prize?
I think it’s this: to do (and not do) what we were designed
for. That’s the goal of all trades, all arts, and what each of
them aims at: that the thing they create should do what it was
designed to do. The nurseryman who cares for the vines, the
horse trainer, the dog breeder—this is what they aim at. And
teaching and education—what else are they trying to
accomplish?
So that’s what we should prize. Hold on to that, and you
won’t be tempted to aim at anything else.
And if you can’t stop prizing a lot of other things? Then
you’ll never be free—free, independent, imperturbable.
Because you’ll always be envious and jealous, afraid that
people might come and take it all away from you. Plotting
against those who have them—those things you prize. People
who need those things are bound to be a mess—and bound to
take out their frustrations on the gods. Whereas to respect
your own mind—to prize it—will leave you satisfied with
==>> Page 138
your own self, well integrated into your community and in
tune with the gods as well—embracing what they allot you,
and what they ordain.
17. The elements move upward, downward, in all directions.
The motion of virtue is different—deeper. It moves at a
steady pace on a road hard to discern, and always forward.
18. The way people behave. They refuse to admire their
contemporaries, the people whose lives they share. No, but
to be admired by Posterity—people they’ve never met and
never will—that’s what they set their hearts on. You might as
well be upset at not being a hero to your great-grandfather.
19. Not to assume it’s impossible because you find it hard.
But to recognize that if it’s humanly possible, you can do it
too.
20. In the ring, our opponents can gouge us with their nails or
butt us with their heads and leave a bruise, but we don’t
denounce them for it or get upset with them or regard them
from then on as violent types. We just keep an eye on them
after that. Not out of hatred or suspicion. Just keeping a
friendly distance.
We need to do that in other areas. We need to excuse what
our sparring partners do, and just keep our distance—without
suspicion or hatred.
==>> Page 139
26. If someone asked you how to write your name, would you
clench your teeth and spit out the letters one by one? If he lost
his temper, would you lose yours as well? Or would you just
spell out the individual letters?
Remember—your responsibilities can be broken down
into individual parts as well. Concentrate on those, and finish
the job methodically—without getting stirred up or meeting
anger with anger.
27. How cruel—to forbid people to want what they think is
good for them. And yet that’s just what you won’t let them do
when you get angry at their misbehavior. They’re drawn
toward what they think is good for them.
—But it’s not good for them.
Then show them that. Prove it to them. Instead of losing
your temper.
28. Death. The end of sense-perception, of being controlled
by our emotions, of mental activity, of enslavement to our
bodies.
29. Disgraceful: for the soul to give up when the body is still
going strong.
30. To escape imperialization—that indelible stain. It
==>> Page 140
happens. Make sure you remain straightforward, upright,
reverent, serious, unadorned, an ally of justice, pious, kind,
affectionate, and doing your duty with a will. Fight to be the
person philosophy tried to make you.
Revere the gods; watch over human beings. Our lives are
short. The only rewards of our existence here are an
unstained character and unselfish acts.
Take Antoninus as your model, always. His energy in
doing what was rational . . . his steadiness in any situation . .
. his sense of reverence . . . his calm expression . . . his
gentleness . . . his modesty . . . his eagerness to grasp things.
And how he never let things go before he was sure he had
examined them thoroughly, understood them perfectly . . . the
way he put up with unfair criticism, without returning it . . .
how he couldn’t be hurried . . . how he wouldn’t listen to
informers . . . how reliable he was as a judge of character,
and of actions . . . not prone to backbiting, or cowardice, or
jealousy, or empty rhetoric . . . content with the basics—in
living quarters, bedding, clothes, food, servants . . . how hard
he worked, how much he put up with . . . his ability to work
straight through till dusk—because of his simple diet (he
didn’t even need to relieve himself, except at set times) . . .
his constancy and reliability as a friend . . . his tolerance of
people who openly questioned his views and his delight at
seeing his ideas improved on . . . his piety—without a trace
of superstition . . .
==>> Page 141
their trade? Should we as humans feel less responsibility to
our logos than builders or pharmacists do? A logos we share
with the divine?
36. Asia and Europe: distant recesses of the universe.
The ocean: a drop of water.
Mount Athos: a molehill.
The present: a split second in eternity.
Minuscule, transitory, insignificant.
36a. Everything derives from it—that universal mind—either
as effect or consequence. The lion’s jaws, the poisonous
substances, and every harmful thing—from thorns to mud . . .
are by-products of the good and beautiful. So don’t look at
them as alien to what you revere, but focus on the source that
all things spring from.
37. If you’ve seen the present then you’ve seen everything—
as it’s been since the beginning, as it will be forever. The
same substance, the same form. All of it.
38. Keep reminding yourself of the way things are connected,
of their relatedness. All things are implicated in one another
and in sympathy with each other. This event is the
consequence of some other one. Things push and pull on each
==>> Page 142
other, and breathe together, and are one.
39. The things ordained for you—teach yourself to be at one
with those. And the people who share them with you—treat
them with love.
With real love.
40. Implements, tools, equipment. If they do what they were
designed for, then they work. Even if the person who
designed them is miles away.
But with naturally occurring things, the force that designed
them is present within them and remains there. Which is why
we owe it special reverence, with the recognition that if you
live and act as it dictates, then everything in you is
intelligently ordered. Just as everything in the world is.
41. You take things you don’t control and define them as
“good” or “bad.” And so of course when the “bad” things
happen, or the “good” ones don’t, you blame the gods and
feel hatred for the people responsible—or those you decide
to make responsible. Much of our bad behavior stems from
trying to apply those criteria. If we limited “good” and “bad”
to our own actions, we’d have no call to challenge God, or to
treat other people as enemies.
42. All of us are working on the same project. Some
==>> Page 143
And if they make no decisions, about anything—and it’s
blasphemous even to think so (because if so, then let’s stop
sacrificing, praying, swearing oaths, and doing all the other
things we do, believing the whole time that the gods are right
here with us)—if they decide nothing about our lives . . .
well, I can still make decisions. Can still consider what it’s
to my benefit to do. And what benefits anyone is to do what
his own nature requires. And mine is rational. Rational and
civic.
My city and state are Rome—as Antoninus. But as a human
being? The world. So for me, “good” can only mean what’s
good for both communities.
45. Whatever happens to you is for the good of the world.
That would be enough right there. But if you look closely
you’ll generally notice something else as well: whatever
happens to a single person is for the good of others. (Good in
the ordinary sense—as the world defines it.)
46. Just as the arena and the other spectacles weary you—
you’ve seen them all before—and the repetition grates on
your nerves, so too with life. The same things, the same
causes, on all sides.
How much longer?
47. Keep this constantly in mind: that all sorts of people have
==>> Page 144
died—all professions, all nationalities. Follow the thought
all the way down to Philistion, Phoebus, and Origanion. Now
extend it to other species.
We have to go there too, where all of them have already
gone:
. . . the eloquent and the wise—Heraclitus, Pythagoras,
Socrates . . .
. . . the heroes of old, the soldiers and kings who followed
them . . .
. . . Eudoxus, Hipparchus, Archimedes . . .
. . . the smart, the generous, the hardworking, the cunning,
the selfish . . .
. . . and even Menippus and his cohorts, who laughed at
thewhole brief, fragile business.
All underground for a long time now.
And what harm does it do them? Or the others either—the
ones whose names we don’t even know?
==>> Page 145
accomplished.
51. Ambition means tying your well-being to what other
people say or do.
Self-indulgence means tying it to the things that happen to
you.
Sanity means tying it to your own actions.
52. You don’t have to turn this into something. It doesn’t
have to upset you. Things can’t shape our decisions by
themselves.
53. Practice really hearing what people say. Do your best to
get inside their minds.
54. What injures the hive injures the bee.
55. If the crew talked back to the captain, or patients to their
doctor, then whose authority would they accept? How could
the passengers be kept safe or the patient healthy?
56. All those people who came into the world with me and
have already left it.
57. Honey tastes bitter to a man with jaundice. People with
rabies are terrified of water. And a child’s idea of beauty is
a ball. Why does that upset you? Do you think falsehood is
==>> Page 146
less powerful than bile or a rabid dog?
58. No one can keep you from living as your nature requires.
Nothing can happen to you that is not required by Nature.
59. The people they want to ingratiate themselves with, and
the results, and the things they do in the process. How
quickly it will all be erased by time. How much has been
erased already.
==>> Page 147
 
1. Evil: the same old thing.
No matter what happens, keep this in mind: It’s the same
old thing, from one end of the world to the other. It fills the
history books, ancient and modern, and the cities, and the
houses too. Nothing new at all.
Familiar, transient.
2. You cannot quench understanding unless you put out the
insights that compose it. But you can rekindle those at will,
like glowing coals. I can control my thoughts as necessary;
then how can I be troubled? What is outside my mind means
nothing to it. Absorb that lesson and your feet stand firm.
You can return to life. Look at things as you did before.
And life returns.
3. Pointless bustling of processions, opera arias, herds of
sheep and cattle, military exercises. A bone flung to pet
poodles, a little food in the fish tank. The miserable
==>> Page 148
servitude of ants, scampering of frightened mice, puppets
jerked on strings.
Surrounded as we are by all of this, we need to practice
acceptance. Without disdain. But remembering that our own
worth is measured by what we devote our energy to.
4. Focus on what is said when you speak and on what results
from each action. Know what the one aims at, and what the
other means.
5. Is my intellect up to this? If so, then I’ll put it to work, like
a tool provided by nature. And if it isn’t, then I’ll turn the job
over to someone who can do better—unless I have no choice.
Or I do the best I can with it, and collaborate with
whoever can make use of it, to do what the community needs
done. Because whatever I do—alone or with others—can
aim at one thing only: what squares with those requirements.
6. So many who were remembered already forgotten, and
those who remembered them long gone.
7. Don’t be ashamed to need help. Like a soldier storming a
wall, you have a mission to accomplish. And if you’ve been
wounded and you need a comrade to pull you up? So what?
8. Forget the future. When and if it comes, you’ll have the
==>> Page 149
unit.
This will be clearer to you if you remind yourself: I am a
single limb (melos) of a larger body—a rational one.
Or you could say “a part” (meros)—only a letter’s
difference. But then you’re not really embracing other
people. Helping them isn’t yet its own reward. You’re still
seeing it only as The Right Thing To Do. You don’t yet
realize who you’re really helping.
14. Let it happen, if it wants, to whatever it can happen to.
And what’s affected can complain about it if it wants. It
doesn’t hurt me unless I interpret its happening as harmful to
me. I can choose not to.
15. No matter what anyone says or does, my task is to be
good. Like gold or emerald or purple repeating to itself, “No
matter what anyone says or does, my task is to be emerald,
my color undiminished.”
16. The mind doesn’t get in its own way. It doesn’t frighten
itself into desires. If other things can scare or hurt it, let them;
it won’t go down that road on the basis of its own
perceptions.
Let the body avoid discomfort (if it can), and if it feels it,
say so. But the soul is what feels fear and pain, and what
==>> Page 150
conceives of them in the first place, and it suffers nothing.
Because it will never conclude that it has.
The mind in itself has no needs, except for those it creates
itself. Is undisturbed, except for its own disturbances. Knows
no obstructions, except those from within.
17. Well-being is good luck, or good character.
17a. (But what are you doing here, Perceptions? Get back to
where you came from, and good riddance. I don’t need you.
Yes, I know, it was only force of habit that brought you. No,
I’m not angry with you. Just go away.)
18. Frightened of change? But what can exist without it?
What’s closer to nature’s heart? Can you take a hot bath and
leave the firewood as it was? Eat food without transforming
it? Can any vital process take place without something being
changed?
Can’t you see? It’s just the same with you—and just as
vital to nature.
19. Carried through existence as through rushing rapids. All
bodies. Which are sprung from nature and cooperate with it,
as our limbs do with each other. Time has swallowed a
Chrysippus, a Socrates and an Epictetus, many times over.
==>> Page 151
everything you see and use it as material for something else
—over and over again. So that the world is continually
renewed.
26. When people injure you, ask yourself what good or harm
they thought would come of it. If you understand that, you’ll
feel sympathy rather than outrage or anger. Your sense of
good and evil may be the same as theirs, or near it, in which
case you have to excuse them. Or your sense of good and evil
may differ from theirs. In which case they’re misguided and
deserve your compassion. Is that so hard?
27. Treat what you don’t have as nonexistent. Look at what
you have, the things you value most, and think of how much
you’d crave them if you didn’t have them. But be careful.
Don’t feel such satisfaction that you start to overvalue them
—that it would upset you to lose them.
28. Self-contraction: the mind’s requirements are satisfied by
doing what we should, and by the calm it brings us.
29. Discard your misperceptions.
Stop being jerked like a puppet.
Limit yourself to the present.
Understand what happens—to you, to others.
==>> Page 152
Analyze what exists, break it all down: material and
cause.
Anticipate your final hours.
Other people’s mistakes? Leave them to their makers.
30. To direct your thoughts to what is said. To focus the mind
on what happens and what makes it happen.
31. Wash yourself clean. With simplicity, with humility, with
indifference to everything but right and wrong.
Care for other human beings. Follow God.
31a. “ . . . all are relative,” it’s been said, “and in reality
only atoms.” It’s enough to remember the first half: “all are
relative.” “ Which is little enough. “
32. [On death:] If atoms, dispersed. If oneness, quenched or
changed.
33. [On pain:] Unendurable pain brings its own end with it.
Chronic pain is always endurable: the intelligence maintains
serenity by cutting itself off from the body, the mind remains
undiminished. And the parts that pain affects—let them speak
for themselves, if they can.
34. [On Ambition:] How their minds work, the things they
==>> Page 153
42. “For what is just and good is on my side.”
43. No chorus of lamentation, no hysterics.
44. “Then the only proper response for me to make is this:
‘You are much mistaken, my friend, if you think that any man
worth his salt cares about the risk of death and doesn’t
concentrate on this alone: whether what he’s doing is right or
wrong, and his behavior a good man’s or a bad one’s.’ ”
45. “It’s like this, gentlemen of the jury: The spot where a
person decides to station himself, or wherever his
commanding officer stations him—well, I think that’s where
he ought to take his stand and face the enemy, and not worry
about being killed, or about anything but doing his duty.”
46. “But, my good friend, consider the possibility that
nobility and virtue are not synonymous with the loss or
preservation of one’s life. Is it not possible that a real man
should forget about living a certain number of years, and
should not cling to life, but leave it up to the gods, accepting,
as women say, that ‘no one can escape his fate,’ and turn his
attention to how he can best live the life before him?”
47. To watch the courses of the stars as if you revolved with
them. To keep constantly in mind how the elements alter into
one another. Thoughts like this wash off the mud of life
below.
==>> Page 154
48. [Plato has it right.] If you want to talk about people, you
need to look down on the earth from above. Herds, armies,
farms; weddings, divorces, births, deaths; noisy courtrooms,
desert places; all the foreign peoples; holidays, days of
mourning, market days . . . all mixed together, a harmony of
opposites.
49. Look at the past—empire succeeding empire—and from
that, extrapolate the future: the same thing. No escape from
the rhythm of events.
Which is why observing life for forty years is as good as a
thousand. Would you really see anything new?
50. “ . . . Earth’s offspring back to earth
But all that’s born of heaven
To heaven returns again.”
Either that or the cluster of atoms pulls apart and one way or
another the insensible elements disperse.
51. “. . . with food and drink and magic spells
Seeking some novel way to frustrate death.”
==>> Page 155
Everything has to do what it was made for. And other
things were made for those with logos. In this respect as in
others: lower things exist for the sake of higher ones, and
higher things for one another.
Now, the main thing we were made for is to work with
others.
Secondly, to resist our body’s urges. Because things
driven 
by logos—by thought—have the capacity for
detachment—to resist impulses and sensations, both of which
are merely corporeal. Thought seeks to be their master, not
their subject. And so it should: they were created for its use.
And the third thing is to avoid rashness and credulity.
The mind that grasps this and steers straight ahead should
be able to hold its own.
56. Think of yourself as dead. You have lived your life. Now
take what’s left and live it properly.
57. To love only what happens, what was destined. No
greater harmony.
58. In all that happens, keep before your eyes those who
experienced it before you, and felt shock and outrage and
resentment at it.
==>> Page 156
And now where are they? Nowhere.
Is that what you want to be like? Instead of avoiding all
these distracting assaults—leaving the alarms and flight to
others—and concentrating on what you can do with it all?
Because you can use it, treat it as raw material. Just pay
attention, and resolve to live up to your own expectations. In
everything. And when faced with a choice, remember: our
business is with things that really matter.
59. Dig deep; the water—goodness—is down there. And as
long as you keep digging, it will keep bubbling up.
60. What the body needs is stability. To be impervious to
jolts in all it is and does. The cohesiveness and beauty that
intelligence lends to the face—that’s what the body needs.
But it should come without effort.
61. Not a dancer but a wrestler: waiting, poised and dug in,
for sudden assaults.
62. Look at who they really are, the people whose approval
you long for, and what their minds are really like. Then you
won’t blame the ones who make mistakes they can’t help, and
you won’t feel a need for their approval. You will have seen
the sources of both—their judgments and their actions.
==>> Page 157
whether he debated with the sophists more adeptly, whether
he showed greater endurance by spending the night out in the
cold, and when he was ordered to arrest the man from
Salamis decided it was preferable to refuse, and “swaggered
about the streets” (which one could reasonably doubt).
What matters is what kind of soul he had.
Whether he was satisfied to treat men with justice and the
gods with reverence and didn’t lose his temper unpredictably
at evil done by others, didn’t make himself the slave of other
people’s ignorance, didn’t treat anything that nature did as
abnormal, or put up with it as an unbearable imposition,
didn’t put his mind in his body’s keeping.
67. Nature did not blend things so inextricably that you can’t
draw your own boundaries—place your own well-being in
your own hands. It’s quite possible to be a good man without
anyone realizing it. Remember that.
And this too: you don’t need much to live happily. And
just because you’ve abandoned your hopes of becoming a
great thinker or scientist, don’t give up on attaining freedom,
achieving humility, serving others, obeying God.
68. To live life in peace, immune to all compulsion. Let them
scream whatever they want. Let animals dismember this soft
flesh that covers you. How would any of that stop you from
==>> Page 158
keeping your mind calm—reliably sizing up what’s around
you—and ready to make good use of whatever happens? So
that Judgment can look the event in the eye and say, “This is
what you really are, regardless of what you may look like.”
While Adaptability adds, “You’re just what I was looking
for.” Because to me the present is a chance for the exercise
of rational virtue—civic virtue—in short, the art that men
share with gods. Both treat whatever happens as wholly
natural; not novel or hard to deal with, but familiar and
easily handled.
69. Perfection of character: to live your last day, every day,
without frenzy, or sloth, or pretense.
70. The gods live forever and yet they don’t seem annoyed at
having to put up with human beings and their behavior
throughout eternity. And not only put up with but actively
care for them.
And you—on the verge of death—you still refuse to care
for them, although you’re one of them yourself.
71. It’s silly to try to escape other people’s faults. They are
inescapable. Just try to escape your own.
72. Whenever the force that makes us rational and social
encounters something that is neither, then it can reasonably
regard it as inferior.
==>> Page 159
 
Book 8
==>> Page 160
 
1. Another encouragement to humility: you can’t claim to
have lived your life as a philosopher—not even your whole
adulthood. You can see for yourself how far you are from
philosophy. And so can many others. You’re tainted. It’s not
so easy now—to have a reputation as a philosopher. And
your position is an obstacle as well.
So you know how things stand. Now forget what they think
of you. Be satisfied if you can live the rest of your life,
however short, as your nature demands. Focus on that, and
don’t let anything distract you. You’ve wandered all over
and finally realized that you never found what you were
after: how to live. Not in syllogisms, not in money, or fame,
or self-indulgence. Nowhere.
—Then where is it to be found?
In doing what human nature requires.
—How?
==>> Page 161
The second step: Concentrate on what you have to do. Fix
your eyes on it. Remind yourself that your task is to be a
good human being; remind yourself what nature demands of
people. Then do it, without hesitation, and speak the truth as
you see it. But with kindness. With humility. Without
hypocrisy.
6. Nature’s job: to shift things elsewhere, to transform them,
to pick them up and move them here and there. Constant
alteration. But not to worry: there’s nothing new here.
Everything is familiar. Even the proportions are unchanged.
7. Nature of any kind thrives on forward progress. And
progress for a rational mind means not accepting falsehood
or uncertainty in its perceptions, making unselfish actions its
only aim, seeking and shunning only the things it has control
over, embracing what nature demands of it—the nature in
which it participates, as the leaf’s nature does in the tree’s.
Except that the nature shared by the leaf is without
consciousness or reason, and subject to impediments.
Whereas that shared by human beings is without
impediments, and rational, and just, since it allots to each
and every thing an equal and proportionate share of time,
being, purpose, action, chance. Examine it closely. Not
whether they’re identical point by point, but in the aggregate:
this weighed against that.
8. No time for reading. For controlling your arrogance, yes.
==>> Page 162
For overcoming pain and pleasure, yes. For outgrowing
ambition, yes. For not feeling anger at stupid and unpleasant
people—even for caring about them—for that, yes.
9. Don’t be overheard complaining about life at court. Not
even to yourself.
10. Remorse is annoyance at yourself for having passed up
something that’s to your benefit. But if it’s to your benefit it
must be good—something a truly good person would be
concerned about.
But no truly good person would feel remorse at passing up
pleasure.
So it cannot be to your benefit, or good.
11. What is this, fundamentally? What is its nature and
substance, its reason for being? What is it doing in the
world? How long is it here for?
12. When you have trouble getting out of bed in the morning,
remember that your defining characteristic—what defines a
human being—is to work with others. Even animals know
how to sleep. And it’s the characteristic activity that’s the
more natural one—more innate and more satisfying.
13. Apply them constantly, to everything that happens:
==>> Page 163
18. What dies doesn’t vanish. It stays here in the world,
transformed, dissolved, as parts of the world, and of you.
Which are transformed in turn—without grumbling.
19. Everything is here for a purpose, from horses to vine
shoots. What’s surprising about that? Even the sun will tell
you, “I have a purpose,” and the other gods as well. And why
were you born? For pleasure? See if that answer will stand
up to questioning.
20. Nature is like someone throwing a ball in the air, gauging
its rise and arc—and where it will fall. And what does the
ball gain as it flies upward? Or lose when it plummets to
earth?
What does the bubble gain from its existence? Or lose by
bursting?
And the same for a candle.
21. Turn it inside out: What is it like? What is it like old? Or
sick? Or selling itself on the streets?
They all die soon—praiser and praised, rememberer and
remembered. Remembered in these parts or in a corner of
them. Even there they don’t all agree with each other (or
even with themselves).
==>> Page 164
And the whole earth a mere point in space.
22. Stick to what’s in front of you—idea, action, utterance.
22a. This is what you deserve. You could be good today. But
instead you choose tomorrow.
23. What I do? I attribute it to human beneficence.
What is done to me? I accept it—and attribute it to the
gods, and that source from which all things together flow.
24. Like the baths—oil, sweat, dirt, grayish water, all of it
disgusting.
The whole of life, all of the visible world.
25. Verus, leaving Lucilla behind, then Lucilla. Maximus,
leaving 
Secunda. 
And 
Secunda. 
Diotimus, 
leaving
Epitynchanus. 
Then 
Epitynchanus. 
Faustina, 
leaving
Antoninus. Then Antoninus.
So with all of them.
Hadrian, leaving Celer. And Celer.
Where have they gone, the brilliant, the insightful ones, the
proud? Brilliant as Charax and Demetrius the Platonist and
Eudaemon and the rest of them. Short-lived creatures, long
==>> Page 165
evil can touch them.
29. To erase false perceptions, tell yourself: I have it in me
to keep my soul from evil, lust and all confusion. To see
things as they are and treat them as they deserve. Don’t
overlook this innate ability.
30. To speak to the Senate—or anyone—in the right tone,
without being overbearing. To choose the right words.
31. Augustus’s court: his wife, his daughter, his grandsons,
his stepsons, his sister, Agrippa, the relatives, servants,
friends, Areius, Maecenas, the doctors, the sacrificial priests
. . . the whole court, dead.
And consider the others . . . not just the deaths of
individuals (like the family of the Pompeys).
That 
line 
they 
write 
on 
tombs—“last 
surviving
descendant.” Consider their ancestors’ anxiety—that there be
a successor. But someone has to be the last. There, too, the
death of a whole house.
32. You have to assemble your life yourself—action by
action. And be satisfied if each one achieves its goal, as far
as it can. No one can keep that from happening.
—But there are external obstacles. . . .
==>> Page 166
Not to behaving with justice, self-control, and good sense.
—Well, but perhaps to some more concrete action.
But if you accept the obstacle and work with what you’re
given, an alternative will present itself—another piece of
what you’re trying to assemble. Action by action.
33. To accept it without arrogance, to let it go with
indifference.
34. Have you ever seen a severed hand or foot, or a
decapitated head, just lying somewhere far away from the
body it belonged to . . . ? That’s what we do to ourselves—
or try to—when we rebel against what happens to us, when
we segregate ourselves. Or when we do something selfish.
You have torn yourself away from unity—your natural
state, one you were born to share in. Now you’ve cut
yourself off from it.
But you have one advantage here: you can reattach
yourself. A privilege God has granted to no other part of no
other whole—to be separated, cut away, and reunited. But
look how he’s singled us out. He’s allowed us not to be
broken off in the first place, and when we are he’s allowed
us to return, to graft ourselves back on, and take up our old
position once again: part of a whole.
==>> Page 167
38. The stench of decay. Rotting meat in a bag.
Look at it clearly. If you can.
39. “To the best of my judgment, when I look at the human
character I see no virtue placed there to counter justice. But I
see one to counter pleasure: self-control.”
40. Stop perceiving the pain you imagine and you’ll remain
completely unaffected.
—“You?”
Your logos.
—But I’m not just logos.
Fine. Just don’t let the logos be injured. If anything else is,
let it decide that for itself.
41. For animate beings, “harmful” is whatever obstructs the
operation of their senses—or the fulfillment of what they
intend. Similar obstructions constitute harm to plants. So too
for rational creatures, anything that obstructs the operation of
the mind is harmful.
Apply this to yourself.
Do pain and pleasure have their hooks in you? Let the
==>> Page 168
senses deal with it. Are there obstacles to your action? If you
failed to reckon with the possibility, then that would harm
you, as a rational being. But if you use common sense, you
haven’t been harmed or even obstructed. No one can obstruct
the operations of the mind. Nothing can get at them—not fire
or steel, not tyrants, not abuse—nothing. As long as it’s “a
sphere . . . in perfect stillness.”
42. I have no right to do myself an injury. Have I ever injured
anyone else if I could avoid it?
43. People find pleasure in different ways. I find it in
keeping my mind clear. In not turning away from people or
the things that happen to them. In accepting and welcoming
everything I see. In treating each thing as it deserves.
44. Give yourself a gift: the present moment.
People out for posthumous fame forget that the Generations
To Come will be the same annoying people they know now.
And just as mortal. What does it matter to you if they say x
about you, or think y?
45. Lift me up and hurl me. Wherever you will. My spirit
will be gracious to me there—gracious and satisfied—as
long as its existence and actions match its nature.
Is there any reason why my soul should suffer and be
==>> Page 169
embracing the obstacles too.
48. Remember that when it withdraws into itself and finds
contentment there, the mind is invulnerable. It does nothing
against its will, even if its resistance is irrational. And if its
judgment is deliberate and grounded in logic . . . ?
The mind without passions is a fortress. No place is more
secure. Once we take refuge there we are safe forever. Not to
see this is ignorance. To see it and not seek safety means
misery.
49. Nothing but what you get from first impressions. That
someone has insulted you, for instance. That—but not that it’s
done you any harm. The fact that my son is sick—that I can
see. But “that he might die of it,” no. Stick with first
impressions. Don’t extrapolate. And nothing can happen to
you.
Or extrapolate. From a knowledge of all that can happen in
the world.
50. The cucumber is bitter? Then throw it out.
There are brambles in the path? Then go around them.
That’s all you need to know. Nothing more. Don’t demand
to know “why such things exist.” Anyone who understands
==>> Page 170
the world will laugh at you, just as a carpenter would if you
seemed shocked at finding sawdust in his workshop, or a
shoemaker at scraps of leather left over from work.
Of course, they have a place to dispose of these; nature has
no door to sweep things out of. But the wonderful thing about
its workmanship is how, faced with that limitation, it takes
everything within it that seems broken, old and useless,
transforms it into itself, and makes new things from it. So that
it doesn’t need material from any outside source, or
anywhere to dispose of what’s left over. It relies on itself for
all it needs: space, material, and labor.
51. No carelessness in your actions. No confusion in your
words. No imprecision in your thoughts. No retreating into
your own soul, or trying to escape it. No overactivity.
They kill you, cut you with knives, shower you with
curses. And that somehow cuts your mind off from clearness,
and sanity, and self-control, and justice?
A man standing by a spring of clear, sweet water and
cursing it. While the fresh water keeps on bubbling up. He
can shovel mud into it, or dung, and the stream will carry it
away, wash itself clean, remain unstained.
To have that. Not a cistern but a perpetual spring.
==>> Page 171
person is harmed by it—and he can stop being harmed as
soon as he decides to.
56. Other people’s wills are as independent of mine as their
breath and bodies. We may exist for the sake of one another,
but our will rules its own domain. Otherwise the harm they
do would cause harm to me. Which is not what God intended
—for my happiness to rest with someone else.
57. We speak of the sun’s light as “pouring down on us,” as
“pouring over us” in all directions. Yet it’s never poured out.
Because it doesn’t really pour; it extends. Its beams (aktai)
get their name from their extension (ekteinesthai).
To see the nature of a sunbeam, look at light as it falls
through a narrow opening into a dark room. It extends in a
straight line, striking any solid object that stands in its way
and blocks the space beyond it. There it remains—not
vanishing, or falling away.
That’s what the outpouring—the diffusion—of thought
should be like: not emptied out, but extended. And not
striking at obstacles with fury and violence, or falling away
before them, but holding its ground and illuminating what
receives it.
What doesn’t transmit light creates its own darkness.
==>> Page 172
58. Fear of death is fear of what we may experience. Nothing
at all, or something quite new. But if we experience nothing,
we can experience nothing bad. And if our experience
changes, then our existence will change with it—change, but
not cease.
59. People exist for one another. You can instruct or endure
them.
60. An arrow has one motion and the mind another. Even
when pausing, even when weighing conclusions, the mind is
moving forward, toward its goal.
61. To enter others’ minds and let them enter yours.
==>> Page 173
 
1. Injustice is a kind of blasphemy. Nature designed rational
beings for each other’s sake: to help—not harm—one
another, as they deserve. To transgress its will, then, is to
blaspheme against the oldest of the gods.
And to lie is to blaspheme against it too. Because “nature”
means the nature of that which is. And that which is and that
which is the case are closely linked, so that nature is
synonymous with Truth—the source of all true things. To lie
deliberately is to blaspheme—the liar commits deceit, and
thus injustice. And likewise to lie without realizing it.
Because the involuntary liar disrupts the harmony of nature—
its order. He is in conflict with the way the world is
structured. As anyone is who deviates toward what is
opposed to the truth—even against his will. Nature gave him
the resources to distinguish between true and false. And he
neglected them, and now can’t tell the difference.
And to pursue pleasure as good, and flee from pain as evil
—that too is blasphemous. Someone who does that is bound
==>> Page 174
to find himself constantly reproaching nature—complaining
that it doesn’t treat the good and bad as they deserve, but
often lets the bad enjoy pleasure and the things that produce
it, and makes the good suffer pain, and the things that produce
pain. And moreover, to fear pain is to fear something that’s
bound to happen, the world being what it is—and that again
is blasphemy. While if you pursue pleasure, you can hardly
avoid wrongdoing—which is manifestly blasphemous.
Some things nature is indifferent to; if it privileged one
over the other it would hardly have created both. And if we
want to follow nature, to be of one mind with it, we need to
share its indifference. To privilege pleasure over pain—life
over death, fame over anonymity—is clearly blasphemous.
Nature certainly doesn’t.
And when I say that nature is indifferent to them, I mean
that they happen indifferently, at different times, to the things
that exist and the things that come into being after them,
through some ancient decree of Providence—the decree by
which from some initial starting point it embarked on the
creation that we know, by laying down the principles of what
was to come and determining the generative forces: existence
and change, and their successive stages.
2. Real good luck would be to abandon life without ever
encountering dishonesty, or hypocrisy, or self-indulgence, or
pride. But the “next best voyage” is to die when you’ve had
==>> Page 175
meaningless to those you leave behind. Because that’s all that
could restrain us (if anything could)—the only thing that
could make us want to stay here: the chance to live with
those who share our vision. But now? Look how tiring it is—
this cacophony we live in. Enough to make you say to death,
“Come quickly. Before I start to forget myself, like them.”
4. To do harm is to do yourself harm. To do an injustice is to
do yourself an injustice—it degrades you.
5. And you can also commit injustice by doing nothing.
6. Objective judgment, now, at this very moment.
Unselfish action, now, at this very moment.
Willing acceptance—now, at this very moment—of all
external events.
That’s all you need.
7. Blot out your imagination. Turn your desire to stone.
Quench your appetites. Keep your mind centered on itself.
8. Animals without the logos are assigned the same soul, and
those who have the logos share one too—a rational one. Just
as all earthly creatures share one earth. Just as we all see by
the same light, and breathe the same air—all of us who see
and breathe.
==>> Page 176
9. All things are drawn toward what is like them, if such a
thing exists. All earthly things feel the earth’s tug. All wet
things flow together. And airy things as well, so they have to
be forcibly prevented from mixing. Fire is naturally drawn
upward by that higher fire, but ready to ignite at the slightest
touch of other, earthly flame. So that anything drier than usual
makes good fuel, because less of what hinders combustion is
mixed in with it.
And things that share an intelligent nature are just as prone
to seek out what is like them. If not more so. Because their
superiority in other ways is matched by their greater
readiness to mix and mingle with their counterparts.
Even in irrational beings we see swarms and herds, and
nesting, and love not unlike ours. Because they do have
souls, and the bonding instinct is found in a developed form
—not something we see in plants, or stones, or trees. And
it’s still more developed in rational beings, with their states,
friendships, families, groups, their treaties and truces. And in
those yet more developed there is a kind of unity even
between separate things, the kind that we see in the stars. An
advanced level of development can produce a sympathy even
in things that are quite distinct.
But look how things are now. The rational things are the
only ones that have lost that sense of attraction—of
convergence. Only there do we not see that intermingling. But
==>> Page 177
Stillness.
As the logos of the state requires.
13. Today I escaped from anxiety. Or no, I discarded it,
because it was within me, in my own perceptions—not
outside.
14. Known by long experience, limited in life span, debased
in substance—all of it.
Now as then, in the time of those we buried.
15. Things wait outside us, hover at the door. They keep to
themselves. Ask them who they are and they don’t know, they
can give no account of themselves.
What accounts for them?
The mind does.
16. Not being done to, but doing—the source of good and
bad for rational and political beings. Where their own
goodness and badness is found—not in being done to, but in
doing.
17. A rock thrown in the air. It loses nothing by coming
down, gained nothing by going up.
==>> Page 178
18. Enter their minds, and you’ll find the judges you’re so
afraid of—and how judiciously they judge themselves.
19. Everything in flux. And you too will alter in the whirl and
perish, and the world as well.
20. Leave other people’s mistakes where they lie.
21. When we cease from activity, or follow a thought to its
conclusion, it’s a kind of death. And it doesn’t harm us.
Think about your life: childhood, boyhood, youth, old age.
Every transformation a kind of dying. Was that so terrible?
Think about life with your grandfather, your mother, your
adopted father. Realize how many other deaths and
transformations and endings there have been and ask
yourself: Was that so terrible?
Then neither will the close of your life be—its ending and
transformation.
22. Go straight to the seat of intelligence—your own, the
world’s, your neighbor’s.
Your own—to ground it in justice.
The world’s—to remind yourself what it is that you’re
part of.
==>> Page 179
28. The world’s cycles never change—up and down, from
age to age.
Either the world’s intelligence wills each thing (if so,
accept its will), or it exercised that will once—once and for
all—and all else follows as a consequence (and if so, why
worry?).
One way or another: atoms or unity. If it’s God, all is
well. If it’s arbitrary, don’t imitate it.
The earth will cover us all, and then be transformed in
turn, and that too will change, ad infinitum. And that as well,
ad infinitum.
Think about them: the waves of change and alteration,
endlessly breaking. And see our brief mortality for what it is.
29. The design of the world is like a flood, sweeping all
before it. The foolishness of them—little men busy with
affairs of state, with philosophy—or what they think of as
philosophy. Nothing but phlegm and mucus.
—Well, then what?
Do what nature demands. Get a move on—if you have it in
you—and don’t worry whether anyone will give you credit
for it. And don’t go expecting Plato’s Republic; be satisfied
==>> Page 180
with even the smallest progress, and treat the outcome of it
all as unimportant.
Who can change their minds? And without that change,
what is there but groaning, slavery, a pretense of obedience?
Go on and cite Alexander, Philip, Demetrius of Phalerum.
Whether they knew nature’s will and made themselves its
student is for them to say. And if they preferred to play the
king? Well, no one forced me to be their understudy.
The task of philosophy is modest and straightforward.
Don’t tempt me to presumption.
30. To see them from above: the thousands of animal herds,
the rituals, the voyages on calm or stormy seas, the different
ways we come into the world, share it with one another, and
leave it. Consider the lives led once by others, long ago, the
lives to be led by others after you, the lives led even now, in
foreign lands. How many people don’t even know your name.
How many will soon have forgotten it. How many offer you
praise now—and tomorrow, perhaps, contempt.
That to be remembered is worthless. Like fame. Like
everything.
31. Indifference to external events.
And a commitment to justice in your own acts.
==>> Page 181
praise help them.
35. To decompose is to be recomposed.
That’s what nature does. Nature—through whom all things
happen as they should, and have happened forever in just the
same way, and will continue to, one way or another,
endlessly.
That things happen for the worst and always will, that the
gods have no power to regulate them, and the world is
condemned to never-ending evil—how can you say that?
36. Disgust at what things are made of: Liquid, dust, bones,
filth. Or marble as hardened dirt, gold and silver as residues,
clothes as hair, purple dye as shellfish blood. And all the
rest.
And the same with our living breath—transformed from
one thing to another.
37. Enough of this wretched, whining monkey life.
What’s the matter? Is any of this new? What is it you find
surprising?
The purpose? Look at it.
The material? Look at that.
==>> Page 182
That’s all there is.
And the gods? Well, you could try being simpler, gentler.
Even now.
A hundred years or three. . . . No difference.
38. If they’ve injured you, then they’re the ones who suffer
for it.
But have they?
39. Either all things spring from one intelligent source and
form a single body (and the part should accept the actions of
the whole) or there are only atoms, joining and splitting
forever, and nothing else.
So why feel anxiety?
Say to your mind: Are you dead? damaged? brutal?
dishonest?
Are you one of the herd? or grazing like one?
40. Either the gods have power or they don’t. If they don’t,
why pray? If they do, then why not pray for something else
instead of for things to happen or not to happen? Pray not to
feel fear. Or desire, or grief. If the gods can do anything, they
can surely do that for us.
==>> Page 183
Like that. In illness—or any other situation.
Not to let go of philosophy, no matter what happens; not to
bandy words with crackpots and philistines—good rules for
any philosopher.
Concentrate on what you’re doing, and what you’re doing
it with.
42. When you run up against someone else’s shamelessness,
ask yourself this: Is a world without shamelessness possible?
No.
Then don’t ask the impossible. There have to be shameless
people in the world. This is one of them.
The same for someone vicious or untrustworthy, or with
any other defect. Remembering that the whole class has to
exist will make you more tolerant of its members.
Another useful point to bear in mind: What qualities has
nature given us to counter that defect? As an antidote to
unkindness it gave us kindness. And other qualities to
balance other flaws.
And when others stray off course, you can always try to set
them straight, because every wrongdoer is doing something
wrong—doing something the wrong way.
==>> Page 184
And how does it injure you anyway? You’ll find that none
of the people you’re upset about has done anything that could
do damage to your mind. But that’s all that “harm” or
“injury” could mean. Yes, boorish people do boorish things.
What’s strange or unheard-of about that? Isn’t it yourself you
should reproach—for not anticipating that they’d act this
way? The logos gave you the means to see it—that a given
person would act a given way—but you paid no attention.
And now you’re astonished that he’s gone and done it. So
when you call someone “untrustworthy” or “ungrateful,” turn
the reproach on yourself. It was you who did wrong. By
assuming that someone with those traits deserved your trust.
Or by doing them a favor and expecting something in return,
instead of looking to the action itself for your reward. What
else did you expect from helping someone out? Isn’t it
enough that you’ve done what your nature demands? You
want a salary for it too? As if your eyes expected a reward
for seeing, or your feet for walking. That’s what they were
made for. By doing what they were designed to do, they’re
performing their function. Whereas humans were made to
help others. And when we do help others—or help them to
do something—we’re doing what we were designed for. We
perform our function.
==>> Page 185
 
1. To my soul:
Are you ever going to achieve goodness? Ever going to be
simple, whole, and naked—as plain to see as the body that
contains you? Know what an affectionate and loving
disposition would feel like? Ever be fulfilled, ever stop
desiring—lusting and longing for people and things to enjoy?
Or for more time to enjoy them? Or for some other place or
country—“a more temperate clime”? Or for people easier to
get along with? And instead be satisfied with what you have,
and accept the present—all of it. And convince yourself that
everything is the gift of the gods, that things are good and
always will be, whatever they decide and have in store for
the preservation of that perfect entity—good and just and
beautiful, creating all things, connecting and embracing them,
and gathering in their separated fragments to create more like
them.
Will you ever take your stand as a fellow citizen with gods
and human beings, blaming no one, deserving no one’s
==>> Page 186
censure?
2. Focus on what nature demands, as if you were governed
by that alone. Then do that, and accept it, unless your nature
as a living being would be degraded by it.
Then focus on what that nature demands, and accept that
too—unless your nature as a rational being would be
degraded by it.
And, of course, “rational” also implies “civic.”
Follow these guidelines and don’t waste time on anything
else.
3. Everything that happens is either endurable or not.
If it’s endurable, then endure it. Stop complaining.
If it’s unendurable . . . then stop complaining. Your
destruction will mean its end as well.
Just remember: you can endure anything your mind can
make endurable, by treating it as in your interest to do so.
In your interest, or in your nature.
4. If they’ve made a mistake, correct them gently and show
them where they went wrong. If you can’t do that, then the
==>> Page 187
transformation). If the process is harmful to the parts and
unavoidable, then it’s hard to see how the whole can run
smoothly, with parts of it passing from one state to another,
all of them built only to be destroyed in different ways. Does
nature set out to cause its own components harm, and make
them vulnerable to it—indeed, predestined to it? Or is it
oblivious to what goes on? Neither one seems very
plausible.
But suppose we throw out “nature” and explain these
things through inherent properties. It would still be absurd to
say that the individual things in the world are inherently
prone to change, and at the same time be astonished at it or
complain—on the grounds that it was happening “contrary to
nature.” And least of all when things return to the state from
which they came. Because our elements are either simply
dispersed, or are subject to a kind of gravitation—the solid
portions being pulled toward earth, and what is ethereal
drawn into the air, until they’re absorbed into the universal
logos—which is subject to periodic conflagrations, or
renewed through continual change.
And don’t imagine either that those elements—the solid
ones and the ethereal—are with us from our birth. Their
influx took place yesterday, or the day before—from the food
we ate, the air we breathed.
And that’s what changes—not the person your mother gave
==>> Page 188
birth to.
—But if you’re inextricably linked to it through your sense
of individuality?
That’s not what we’re talking about here.
8. Epithets for yourself: Upright. Modest. Straightforward.
Sane. Cooperative. Disinterested.
Try not to exchange them for others.
And if you should forfeit them, set about getting them back.
Keep in mind that “sanity” means understanding things—
each individual thing—for what they are. And not losing the
thread.
And “cooperation” means accepting what nature assigns
you—accepting it willingly.
And “disinterest” means that the intelligence should rise
above the movements of the flesh—the rough and the smooth
alike. Should rise above fame, above death, and everything
like them.
If you maintain your claim to these epithets—without
caring if others apply them to you or not—you’ll become a
new person, living a new life. To keep on being the person
==>> Page 189
• at accomplishing practical ends
• at the exercise of thought
• at maintaining a confidence founded on understanding.
An unobtrusive confidence—hidden in plain sight.
When will you let yourself enjoy straightforwardness?
Seriousness? Or understanding individual things—their
nature and substance, their place in the world, their life span,
their composition, who can possess them, whose they are to
give and to receive?
10. Spiders are proud of catching flies, men of catching
hares, fish in a net, boars, bears, Sarmatians . . .
Criminal psychology.
11. How they all change into one another—acquire the
ability to see that. Apply it constantly; use it to train yourself.
Nothing is as conducive to spiritual growth.
11a. He has stripped away his body and—realizing that at
some point soon he will have to abandon mankind and leave
all this behind—has dedicated himself to serving justice in
==>> Page 190
all he does, and nature in all that happens. What people say
or think about him, or how they treat him, isn’t something he
worries about. Only these two questions: Is what he’s doing
now the right thing to be doing? Does he accept and welcome
what he’s been assigned? He has stripped away all other
occupations, all other tasks. He wants only to travel a
straight path—to God, by way of law.
12. Why all this guesswork? You can see what needs to be
done. If you can see the road, follow it. Cheerfully, without
turning back. If not, hold up and get the best advice you can.
If anything gets in the way, forge on ahead, making good use
of what you have on hand, sticking to what seems right. (The
best goal to achieve, and the one we fall short of when we
fail.)
12a. To follow the logos in all things is to be relaxed and
energetic, joyful and serious at once.
13. When you wake up, ask yourself:
Does it make any difference to you if other people blame
you for doing what’s right?
It makes no difference.
Have you forgotten what the people who are so vociferous
in praise or blame of others are like as they sleep and eat?
==>> Page 191
Or that everything was born to die.
19. How they act when they eat and sleep and mate and
defecate and all the rest. Then when they order and exult, or
rage and thunder from on high. And yet, just consider the
things they submitted to a moment ago, and the reasons for it
—and the things they’ll submit to again before very long.
20. Each of us needs what nature gives us, when nature gives
it.
21. “The earth knows longing for the rain, the sky/knows
longing . . .” And the world longs to create what will come to
be. I tell it “I share your longing.”
(And isn’t that what we mean by “inclined to happen”?)
22. Possibilities:
i. To keep on living (you should be used to it by now)
ii. To end it (it was your choice, after all)
iii. To die (having met your obligations)
==>> Page 192
Those are the only options. Reason for optimism.
23. Keep always before you that “this is no different from an
empty field,” and the things in it are the same as on a
mountaintop, on the seashore, wherever. Plato gets to the
heart of it: “fencing a sheepfold in the mountains, and milking
goats or sheep.”
24. My mind. What is it? What am I making of it? What am I
using it for?
Is it empty of thought?
Isolated and torn loose from those around it?
Melted into flesh and blended with it, so that it shares its
urges?
25. When a slave runs away from his master, we call him a
fugitive slave. But the law of nature is a master too, and to
break it is to become a fugitive.
To feel grief, anger or fear is to try to escape from
something decreed by the ruler of all things, now or in the
past or in the future. And that ruler is law, which governs
what happens to each of us. To feel grief or anger or fear is
to become a fugitive—a fugitive from justice.
26. He deposits his sperm and leaves. And then a force not
==>> Page 193
do so voluntarily.
29. Stop whatever you’re doing for a moment and ask
yourself: Am I afraid of death because I won’t be able to do
this anymore?
30. When faced with people’s bad behavior, turn around and
ask when you have acted like that. When you saw money as a
good, or pleasure, or social position. Your anger will
subside as soon as you recognize that they acted under
compulsion (what else could they do?).
Or remove the compulsion, if you can.
31. When you look at Satyron, see Socraticus, or Eutyches,
or Hymen.
When you look at Euphrates, see Eutychion or Silvanus.
With Alciphron, see Tropaeophorus.
When you look at Xenophon, see Crito or Severus.
When you look at yourself, see any of the emperors.
And the same with everyone else. Then let it hit you:
Where are they now?
Nowhere . . . or wherever.
==>> Page 194
That way you’ll see human life for what it is. Smoke.
Nothing. Especially when you recall that once things alter
they cease to exist through all the endless years to come.
Then why such turmoil? To live your brief life rightly,
isn’t that enough?
The raw material you’re missing, the opportunities . . . !
What is any of this but training—training for your logos, in
life observed accurately, scientifically.
So keep at it, until it’s fully digested. As a strong stomach
digests whatever it eats. As a blazing fire takes whatever you
throw on it, and makes it light and flame.
32. That no one can say truthfully that you are not a
straightforward or honest person. That anyone who thinks
that believes a falsehood. The responsibility is all yours; no
one can stop you from being honest or straightforward.
Simply resolve not to go on living if you aren’t. It would be
contrary to the logos.
33. Given the material we’re made of, what’s the sanest thing
that we can do or say? Whatever it may be, you can do or say
it. Don’t pretend that anything’s stopping you.
You’ll never stop complaining until you feel the same
pleasure that the hedonist gets from self-indulgence—only
==>> Page 195
34. If you’ve immersed yourself in the principles of truth, the
briefest, most random reminder is enough to dispel all fear
and pain:
. . . leaves that the wind
Drives earthward; such are the generations of men.
Your children, leaves.
Leaves applauding loyally and heaping praise upon you, or
turning around and calling down curses, sneering and
mocking from a safe distance.
A glorious reputation handed down by leaves.
All of these “spring up in springtime”—and the wind
blows them all away. And the tree puts forth others to
replace them.
None of us have much time. And yet you act as if things
were eternal—the way you fear and long for them. . . .
Before long, darkness. And whoever buries you mourned
in their turn.
==>> Page 196
35. A healthy pair of eyes should see everything that can be
seen and not say, “No! Too bright!” (which is a symptom of
ophthalmia).
A healthy sense of hearing or smell should be prepared for
any sound or scent; a healthy stomach should have the same
reaction to all foods, as a mill to what it grinds.
So too a healthy mind should be prepared for anything.
The one that keeps saying, “Are my children all right?” or
“Everyone must approve of me” is like eyes that can only
stand pale colors, or teeth that can handle only mush.
36. It doesn’t matter how good a life you’ve led. There’ll
still be people standing around the bed who will welcome
the sad event.
Even with the intelligent and good. Won’t there be
someone thinking “Finally! To be through with that old
schoolteacher. Even though he never said anything, you could
always feel him judging you.” And that’s for a good man.
How many traits do you have that would make a lot of
people glad to be rid of you?
Remember that, when the time comes. You’ll be less
reluctant to leave if you can tell yourself, “This is the sort of
life I’m leaving. Even the people around me, the ones I spent
so much time fighting for, praying over, caring about—even

1. Characteristics of the rational soul:
Self-perception, self-examination, and the power to make
of itself whatever it wants.
It reaps its own harvest, unlike plants (and, in a different
way, animals), whose yield is gathered in by others.
It reaches its intended goal, no matter where the limit of its
life is set. Not like dancing and theater and things like that,
where the performance is incomplete if it’s broken off in the
middle, but at any point—no matter which one you pick—it
has fulfilled its mission, done its work completely. So that it
can say, “I have what I came for.”
It surveys the world and the empty space around it, and the
way it’s put together. It delves into the endlessness of time to
extend its grasp and comprehension of the periodic births and
rebirths that the world goes through. It knows that those who
come after us will see nothing different, that those who came
before us saw no more than we do, and that anyone with forty
==>> Page 199
But the resolution has to be the result of its own decision,
not just in response to outside forces [like the Christians]. It
has to be considered and serious, persuasive to other people.
Without dramatics.
4. Have I done something for the common good? Then I share
in the benefits.
To stay centered on that. Not to give up.
5. “And your profession?” “Goodness.” (And how is that to
be achieved, except by thought—about the world, about the
nature of people?)
6. First, tragedies. To remind us of what can happen, and that
it happens inevitably—and if something gives you pleasure
on that stage, it shouldn’t cause you anger on this one. You
realize that these are things we all have to go through, and
that even those who cry aloud “o Mount Cithaeron!” have to
endure them. And some excellent lines as well. These, for
example:
If I and my two children cannot move the gods
The gods must have their reasons
==>> Page 200
Or:
And why should we feel anger at the world?
And:
To harvest life like standing stalks of grain
and a good many others.
Then, after tragedy, Old Comedy: instructive in its
frankness, its plain speaking designed to puncture
pretensions. (Diogenes used the same tactic for similar
ends.)
Then consider the Middle (and later the New) Comedy
and what it aimed at—gradually degenerating into mere
realism and empty technique. There are undeniably good
passages, even in those writers, but what was the point of it
all—the script and staging alike?
7. It stares you in the face. No role is so well suited to
philosophy as the one you happen to be in right now.
==>> Page 201
Because anger, too, is weakness, as much as breaking
down and giving up the struggle. Both are deserters: the man
who breaks and runs, and the one who lets himself be
alienated from his fellow humans.
10. The natural can never be inferior to the artificial; art
imitates nature, not the reverse. In which case, that most
highly developed and comprehensive nature—Nature itself—
cannot fall short of artifice in its craftsmanship.
Now, all the arts move from lower goals to higher ones.
Won’t Nature do the same?
Hence justice. Which is the source of all the other virtues.
For how could we do what justice requires if we are
distracted by things that don’t matter, if we are naive,
gullible, inconstant?
11. It’s the pursuit of these things, and your attempts to avoid
them, that leave you in such turmoil. And yet they aren’t
seeking you out; you are the one seeking them.
Suspend judgment about them. And at once they will lie
still, and you will be freed from fleeing and pursuing.
12. The soul as a sphere in equilibrium: Not grasping at
things beyond it or retreating inward. Not fragmenting
outward, not sinking back on itself, but ablaze with light and
==>> Page 202
looking at the truth, without and within.
13. Someone despises me.
That’s their problem.
Mine: not to do or say anything despicable.
Someone hates me. Their problem.
Mine: to be patient and cheerful with everyone, including
them. Ready to show them their mistake. Not spitefully, or to
show off my own self-control, but in an honest, upright way.
Like Phocion (if he wasn’t just pretending). That’s what we
should be like inside, and never let the gods catch us feeling
anger or resentment.
As long as you do what’s proper to your nature, and accept
what the world’s nature has in store—as long as you work
for others’ good, by any and all means—what is there that
can harm you?
14. They flatter one another out of contempt, and their desire
to rule one another makes them bow and scrape.
15. The despicable phoniness of people who say, “Listen,
I’m going to level with you here.” What does that mean? It
shouldn’t even need to be said. It should be obvious—
written in block letters on your forehead. It should be audible
==>> Page 203
that, even if it brings you no glory.
None of us is forbidden to pursue our own good.
17. Source and substance of each thing. What it changes into,
and what it’s like transformed; that nothing can harm it.
18.   i. My relationship to them. That we came into the world
for the sake of one another. Or from another point of view, I
came into it to be their guardian—as the ram is of the flock,
and the bull of the herd.
Start from this: if not atoms, then Nature—directing
everything. In that case, lower things for the sake of higher
ones, and higher ones for one another.
ii. What they’re like eating, in bed, etc. How driven they
are by their beliefs. How proud they are of what they
do.
iii. That if they’re right to do this, then you have no right
to complain. And if they aren’t, then they do it
involuntarily, out of ignorance. Because all souls are
prevented from treating others as they deserve, just as
they are kept from truth: unwillingly. Which is why they
resent being called unjust, or arrogant, or greedy—any
==>> Page 204
suggestion that they aren’t good neighbors.
iv. That you’ve made enough mistakes yourself. You’re
just like them.
Even if there are some you’ve avoided, you have the
potential.
Even if cowardice has kept you from them. Or fear of
what people would say. Or some equally bad reason.
v. That you don’t know for sure it is a mistake. A lot of
things are means to some other end. You have to know
an awful lot before you can judge other people’s actions
with real understanding.
vi. When you lose your temper, or even feel irritated:
that human life is very short. Before long all of us will
be laid out side by side.
vii. That it’s not what they do that bothers us: that’s a
problem for their minds, not ours. It’s our own
misperceptions. Discard them. Be willing to give up
thinking of this as a catastrophe . . . and your anger is
gone. How do you do that? By recognizing that you’ve
suffered no disgrace. Unless disgrace is the only thing
that can hurt you, you’re doomed to commit innumerable
offenses—to become a thief, or heaven only knows
==>> Page 205
It’s courtesy and kindness that define a human being—
and a man. That’s who possesses strength and nerves
and guts, not the angry whiners. To react like that brings
you closer to impassivity—and so to strength. Pain is
the opposite of strength, and so is anger. Both are things
we suffer from, and yield to.
. . . and one more thought, from Apollo:
x. That to expect bad people not to injure others is
crazy. It’s to ask the impossible. And to let them behave
like that to other people but expect them to exempt you
is arrogant—the act of a tyrant.
19. Four habits of thought to watch for, and erase from your
mind when you catch them. Tell yourself:
• This thought is unnecessary.
• This one is destructive to the people around you.
• This wouldn’t be what you really think (to say what you
don’t think—the definition of absurdity).
==>> Page 206
And the fourth reason for self-reproach: that the more
divine part of you has been beaten and subdued by the
degraded mortal part—the body and its stupid self-
indulgence.
20. Your spirit and the fire contained within you are drawn
by their nature upward. But they comply with the world’s
designs and submit to being mingled here below. And the
elements of earth and water in you are drawn by their nature
downward. But are forced to rise, and take up a position not
their own. So even the elements obey the world—when
ordered and compelled—and man their stations until the
signal to abandon them arrives.
So why should your intellect be the only dissenter—the
only one complaining about its posting? It’s not as if anything
is being forced on it. Only what its own nature requires. And
yet it refuses to comply, and sets off in the opposite
direction. Because to be drawn toward what is wrong and
self-indulgent, toward anger and fear and pain, is to revolt
against nature. And for the mind to complain about anything
that happens is to desert its post. It was created to show
reverence—respect for the divine—no less than to act justly.
That too is an element of coexistence and a prerequisite for
justice.
21. “If you don’t have a consistent goal in life, you can’t live
it in a consistent way.”

28. Socrates dressed in a towel, the time Xanthippe took his
cloak and went out. The friends who were embarrassed and
avoided him when they saw him dressed like that, and what
Socrates said to them.

more so life.
30. “. . . For you/Are but a slave and have no claim to

31. “But my heart rejoiced.”
32. “And jeer at virtue with their taunts and sneers.”
33. Stupidity is expecting figs in winter, or children in old
age.
34. As you kiss your son good night, says Epictetus, whisper
to yourself, “He may be dead in the morning.”
Don’t tempt fate, you say.
By talking about a natural event? Is fate tempted when we
speak of grain being reaped?
35. Grapes.
Unripe . . . ripened . . . then raisins.
==>> Page 208
Constant transitions.
Not the “not” but the “not yet.”
36. “No thefts of free will reported.”[—Epictetus.]
37. “We need to master the art of acquiescence. We need to
pay attention to our impulses, making sure they don’t go
unmoderated, that they benefit others, that they’re worthy of
us. We need to steer clear of desire in any form and not try to
avoid what’s beyond our control.”
38. “This is not a debate about just anything,” he said, “but
about sanity itself.”
39. Socrates: What do you want, rational minds or irrational
ones?
—Rational ones.
Healthy or sick?
—Healthy.
Then work to obtain them.
—We already have.
Then why all this squabbling?

1. Everything you’re trying to reach—by taking the long way
round—you could have right now, this moment. If you’d only
stop thwarting your own attempts. If you’d only let go of the
past, entrust the future to Providence, and guide the present
toward reverence and justice.
Reverence: so you’ll accept what you’re allotted. Nature
intended it for you, and you for it.
Justice: so that you’ll speak the truth, frankly and without
evasions, and act as you should—and as other people
deserve.
Don’t let anything deter you: other people’s misbehavior,
your own misperceptions, What People Will Say, or the
feelings of the body that covers you (let the affected part take
care of those). And if, when it’s time to depart, you shunt
everything aside except your mind and the divinity within . . .
if it isn’t ceasing to live that you’re afraid of but never
beginning to live properly . . . then you’ll be worthy of the
==>> Page 211
If you can cut free of impressions that cling to the mind,
free of the future and the past—can make yourself, as
Empedocles says, “a sphere rejoicing in its perfect
stillness,” and concentrate on living what can be lived
(which means the present) . . . then you can spend the time
you have left in tranquillity. And in kindness. And at peace
with the spirit within you.
4. It never ceases to amaze me: we all love ourselves more
than other people, but care more about their opinion than our
own. If a god appeared to us—or a wise human being, even
—and prohibited us from concealing our thoughts or
imagining anything without immediately shouting it out, we
wouldn’t make it through a single day. That’s how much we
value other people’s opinions—instead of our own.
5. How is it that the gods arranged everything with such skill,
such care for our well-being, and somehow overlooked one
thing: that certain people—in fact, the best of them, the gods’
own partners, the ones whose piety and good works brought
them closest to the divine—that these people, when they die,
should cease to exist forever? Utterly vanished.
Well, assuming that’s really true, you can be sure they
would have arranged things differently, if that had been
appropriate. If it were the right thing to do, they could have
done it, and if it were natural, nature would have demanded
it. So from the fact that they didn’t—if that’s the case—we
==>> Page 212
can conclude that it was inappropriate.
Surely you can see yourself that to ask the question is to
challenge the gods’ fairness. And why would you be bringing
in fairness unless the gods are, in fact, fair—and absolutely
so?
And if they are, how could they have carelessly
overlooked something so unfair—so illogical—in setting up
the world?
6. Practice even what seems impossible.
The left hand is useless at almost everything, for lack of
practice. But it guides the reins better than the right. From
practice.
7. The condition of soul and body when death comes for us.
Shortness of life.
Vastness of time before and after.
Fragility of matter.
8. To see the causes of things stripped bare. The aim of
actions.
Pain. Pleasure. Death. Fame.
==>> Page 213
If it’s an inescapable necessity, why resist it?
If it’s Providence, and admits of being worshipped, then
try to be worthy of God’s aid.
If it’s confusion and anarchy, then be grateful that on this
raging sea you have a mind to guide you. And if the storm
should carry you away, let it carry off flesh, breath and all
the rest, but not the mind. Which can’t be swept away.
15. The lamp shines until it is put out, without losing its
gleam, and yet in you it all gutters out so early—truth, justice,
self-control?
16. When someone seems to have injured you:
But how can I be sure?
And in any case, keep in mind:
• that he’s already been tried and convicted—by himself.
(Like scratching your own eyes out.)
• that to expect a bad person not to harm others is like
expecting fig trees not to secrete juice, babies not to cry,
horses not to neigh—the inevitable not to happen.
==>> Page 214
What else could they do—with that sort of character?
If you’re still angry, then get to work on that.
17. If it’s not right, don’t do it. If it’s not true, don’t say it.
Let your intention be < . . . >
18. At all times, look at the thing itself—the thing behind the
appearance—and unpack it by analysis:
• cause
• substance
• purpose
• and the length of time it exists.
19. It’s time you realized that you have something in you
more powerful and miraculous than the things that affect you
and make you dance like a puppet.
What’s in my thoughts at this moment? Fear? Jealousy?
==>> Page 215
as a whole, whose parts, shifting and changing, constantly
renew the world, and keep it on schedule.
Nothing that benefits all things can be ugly or out of place.
The end of life is not an evil—it doesn’t disgrace us. (Why
should we be ashamed of an involuntary act that injures no
one?). It’s a good thing—scheduled by the world, promoting
it, promoted by it.
This is how we become godlike—following God’s path,
and reason’s goals.
24. Three things, essential at all times:
i(a). your own actions: that they’re not arbitrary or
different from what abstract justice would do.
i(b). external events: that they happen randomly or by
design. You can’t complain about chance. You can’t
argue with Providence.
ii. what all things are like, from the planting of the seed
to the quickening of life, and from its quickening to its
relinquishment. Where the parts came from and where
they return to.
iii. that if you were suddenly lifted up and could see life
==>> Page 216
and its variety from a vast height, and at the same time
all the things around you, in the sky and beyond it, you’d
see how pointless it is. And no matter how often you
saw it, it would be the same: the same life forms, the
same life span.
Arrogance . . . about this?
25. Throw out your misperceptions and you’ll be fine. (And
who’s stopping you from throwing them out?)
26. To be angry at something means you’ve forgotten:
That everything that happens is natural.
That the responsibility is theirs, not yours.
And further . . .
==>> Page 217
And how trivial the things we want so passionately are.
And how much more philosophical it would be to take what
we’re given and show uprightness, self-control, obedience to
God, without making a production of it. There’s nothing more
insufferable than people who boast about their own humility.
28. People ask, “Have you ever seen the gods you worship?
How can you be sure they exist?”
Answers:
i. Just look around you.
ii. I’ve never seen my soul either. And yet I revere it.
That’s how I know the gods exist and why I revere them—
from having felt their power, over and over.
29. Salvation: to see each thing for what it is—its nature and
its purpose.
To do only what is right, say only what is true, without
holding back.
What else could it be but to live life fully—to pay out
==>> Page 218
goodness like the rings of a chain, without the slightest gap.
30. Singular, not plural:
Sunlight. Though broken up by walls and mountains and a
thousand other things.
Substance. Though split into a thousand forms, variously
shaped.
Life. Though distributed among a thousand different
natures with their individual limitations.
Intelligence. Even if it seems to be divided.
The 
other 
components—breath, 
matter—lack 
any
awareness or connection to one another (yet unity and its
gravitational pull embrace them too).
But intelligence is uniquely drawn toward what is akin to
it, and joins with it inseparably, in shared awareness.
31. What is it you want? To keep on breathing? What about
feeling? desiring? growing? ceasing to grow? using your
voice? thinking? Which of them seems worth having?
But if you can do without them all, then continue to follow
the logos, and God. To the end. To prize those other things—
to grieve because death deprives us of them—is an obstacle.
==>> Page 219
36. You’ve lived as a citizen in a great city. Five years or a
hundred—what’s the difference? The laws make no
distinction.
And to be sent away from it, not by a tyrant or a dishonest
judge, but by Nature, who first invited you in—why is that so
terrible?
Like the impresario ringing down the curtain on an actor:
“But I’ve only gotten through three acts . . . !”
Yes. This will be a drama in three acts, the length fixed by
the power that directed your creation, and now directs your
dissolution. Neither was yours to determine.
So make your exit with grace—the same grace shown to
you.

Notes
1.1 My grandfather Verus: Verus (1).
1.2 My father: Verus (2).
1.3 My mother: Lucilla.
1.4 My great-grandfather: Severus (1).
To avoid the public schools: Roman aristocrats normally preferred to
have their sons educated by private tutors (often specially trained
household slaves) who were considered safer and more reliable than the
professional schoolmasters who taught all comers for a fee.
1.5 My first teacher: Not named and most likely a slave.
Not to support this side or that: Literally, “not to be a Green or a Blue;
not to support the parmularius [a gladiator with a small shield] or the
scutarius [who carried a larger shield].”
1.6 the camp-bed and the cloak: Symbols of an ascetic lifestyle. Marcus’s
sleeping arrangements are recorded by the Historia Augusta: “He used
to sleep on the ground, and his mother had a hard time convincing him to
sleep on a cot spread with skins.”
1.7 his own copy: It is unclear whether this refers to Arrian’s Discourses of
Epictetus or to a set of unpublished notes, perhaps taken by Rusticus
himself.
1.13 Domitius and Athenodotus: The anecdote Marcus refers to is unknown.
1.14 My brother: Probably a copyist’s error based on confusion between the
names Verus and Severus.
Thrasea, Helvidius, Cato: For the significance of these three figures as
==>> Page 221
unintelligible phrase, which some scholars interpret as a reference to “an
oracle.”
“we need the help . . .”: Apparently a quotation, but not from any
surviving work.
2. On the River Gran, Among the Quadi: The notation is transmitted at the end
of Book 1, but is more likely to belong here. The Gran (or Hron) is a
tributary of the Danube flowing through modern-day Slovakia. The
Quadi were a Suebian tribe in the Morava River valley, subdued during
the Marcomannic Wars of the early 170s.
2. 2 Throw away . . . right now: These words are deleted or transposed
elsewhere by some editors.
2.10 the ones committed out of desire are worse: Strictly speaking, this
assessment is in conflict with Stoic doctrine, which holds that there are
no degrees of wrongness; all wrong actions are equally wrong and it
makes no sense to speak of one as being “worse” than another.
2.13 “delving into . . .”: A line from the lyric poet Pindar (frg. 282), quoted also
by Plato, Theaetetus 173e.
3. In Carnuntum: Transmitted at the end of Book 2, but probably meant to head
Book 3. Carnuntum was a fortress on the Danube which housed the
Legio XIV Gemina and served as the seat of the governor of Upper
Pannonia. Marcus is known to have been in the area in 172 and 173.
3. 3 Chaldaeans: The Chaldaeans (Babylonians) had a special reputation as
astrologers.
Democritus: Apparently an error for another pre-Socratic philosopher,
Pherecydes, who was said to have been eaten by worms. (Democritus’s
name was often coupled with that of Heraclitus, which may explain
Marcus’s slip here.)
Socrates: The “vermin” who killed Socrates are the Athenians who
==>> Page 222
prosecuted and condemned him.
3.6 as Socrates used to say: It is not clear whether Marcus is alluding to a
specific passage (perhaps Plato, Phaedo 83a–b) or merely to a general
impression of Socratic doctrine.
3.14 your Brief Comments: Evidently collections of anecdotes and/or quotations
put together by Marcus himself for his own use, like parts of the extant
Meditations.
3.15 They don’t realize  . . . : The significance of this entry (particularly the last
phrase) is unclear.
3.16 people who do < . . . >: It seems clear that something is missing from the
text, perhaps deliberately omitted by a prudish copyist.
4.3 to ward off all < . . . >: The missing word must be something like “anxiety.”
“The world is nothing but change . . .”: Democritus frg. B 115.
4.18 < . . . > not to be distracted: The text as transmitted includes the words
“good,” “black character,” and “suspicion,” but no coherent sense can
be made of them.
4.19 You’re out of step  . . . : The text of this sentence is disturbed and the
translation correspondingly uncertain.
4.23 The poet: Aristophanes frg. 112.
4.24 “If you seek tranquillity . . .”: Democritus frg. B 3.
4.30 A philosopher without clothes . . . : If the text is sound it is not easy to
interpret convincingly. The rendering here (which differs from most
previous versions) represents my best guess at the sense, but is far from
certain.
4.33 Camillus, Caeso, Volesus, Dentatus: Heroes of the Roman Republic (see
==>> Page 223
exact English equivalent (“pervert,” although overly broad, at least has
the right tone). Marcus is probably using it as a generalized term of
abuse.
5.12 “so many goods . . .”: Proverbial: the rich man owns “so many goods he
has no place to shit.” The saying is at least as old as the fourth-century
B.C. comic poet Menander, who quotes it in the surviving fragments of
his play The Apparition.
5.29 If the smoke makes me cough: The metaphor is drawn from Epictetus,
Discourses 1.25.18.
5.31 “wrong and unworthy . . .”: Homer, Odyssey 4.690.
5.33 “gone from the earth . . .”: Hesiod, Works and Days 197.
5.36 Not to be overwhelmed: The remainder of this book is unintelligible in
places, perhaps because the end of the original papyrus roll suffered
accidental damage. I have divided the text into three separate sections,
but without great confidence that this is correct.
Like the old man: The reference is obscure. A scene from a lost tragedy?
6.13 Crates on Xenocrates: The meaning of this reference is unknown.
6.30 Take Antoninus as your model: The sketch that follows seems to be a
preliminary version of the longer portrait at 1.16.
6.34 perverts: See 5.10 note.
6.42 “those who sleep . . .”: Heraclitus frg. B 75.
the bad line in the play: Chrysippus frg. 1181 (= Plutarch, On Stoic Self-
Contradictions 13f.). Chrysippus compared the existence of evil to a
deliberately bathetic line in a comedy—bad in itself, but an essential part of
a good play.
==>> Page 224
7.12 not: The transmitted text reads “or,” but this can hardly be correct (compare
3.5).
7.15 Like gold or emerald or purple: Compare Epictetus, Discourses 1.2.17–
18: “You see yourself as one thread in a garment . . . But I want to be
the purple thread, the small, glistening one that enhances the others.”
7.24 “ . . . “ or in the end is put out: I have omitted a short phrase from which it
is impossible to extract any meaning.
7.31a “. . . all are relative  . . .”: A paraphrase of Democritus frg. B 9, in which
qualities like sweetness or bitterness are said to be “relative” or
“conventional” rather than inherent (what tastes sweet to one person
may be bitter to another). Marcus apparently sees the observation as
compatible with the Stoic doctrine that “it’s all in how you perceive it”
(12.8), though he naturally rejects the subsequent reference to atoms.
The final phrase is corrupt beyond repair.
7.32 [On death]: The headings of this and the next two entries are probably not
Marcus’s own, but additions by a later reader.
7.35 “If his mind is filled . . .”: Plato, Republic 6.486a.
7.36 “Kingship . . .”: Antisthenes frg. 20b (also quoted by Epictetus, Discourses
4.6.20).
7.38 “And why should we feel anger . . .”: Euripides, frg. 287 (from the lost
Bellerophon quoted also at 11.6).
7.39 “May you bring joy . . .”: Source unknown; perhaps from a lost epic.
7.40 “To harvest life . . .”: Euripides, frg. 757 (from the lost Hypsipyle).
7.41 “If I and my two children . . .”: Euripides, frg. 208 (from the lost Antiope;
quoted also at 11.6).
7.42 “For what is just and good . . .”: Ibid., frg. 918 (from an unknown play).
==>> Page 225
8.35 We have various abilities . . . : The text here appears to be corrupt and the
translation is necessarily uncertain.
8.38 Look at it clearly: The text, meaning and articulation of entries 38 and 39
are very uncertain. Earlier editors printed the opening of 38 as the end
of 37, and took the phrases “Look at it clearly—if you can” and “To the
best of my judgment” as a single unit, though the resulting sentence
yields no coherent sense. I follow J. Dalfen in separating them.
8.39 “To the best of my judgment . . .”: I have placed the entry in quotation
marks on the basis of the opening phrase, which includes a parenthetical
“he [or “someone”] says.” This assumes that the phrase is correctly
transmitted (it is certainly not easy to construe), and that it should be
taken with what follows rather than what precedes, which is far from
certain (see previous note). However, the entry as a whole (an implicit
criticism of the Epicureans’ view of pleasure as the supreme good) does
not strike me as being typical of Marcus’s style, and I suspect he may
indeed be quoting some earlier writer.
8.41 “a sphere . . .”: Empedocles frg. B27, quoted in fuller form at 12.3.
8.57 Its beams get their name . . . : This (false) derivation is a typical example of
ancient etymology, a science in which the early Stoics were much
interested.
9.2 the “next best voyage”: A proverbial phrase meaning having to row when
one cannot sail.
9.24 “Odysseus in the Underworld”: The reference is to Book 11 of the
Odyssey, in which Odysseus descends to Hades and encounters the
shades of his companions who died at Troy.
9.29 Demetrius of Phalerum: It has been suggested that “of Phalerum” is a later
reader’s (mistaken) addition, and that Marcus had in mind the
Hellenistic monarch Demetrius Poliorcetes (“the city-sacker”). But
there seems no reason to doubt the transmitted text.
==>> Page 226
9.41 “During my illness . . .”: Epicurus frg. 191.
10.10 Sarmatians: One of the barbarian tribes Marcus spent his last decade
fighting.
10.21 “The earth knows longing . . .”: Euripides frg. 898.
10.23 “fencing a sheepfold . . .”: A paraphrase of Plato, Theaetetus 174d, in
which we are told that the philosopher will look down on a king as if the
latter were a humble shepherd.
10.31 When you look . . . : Most of the names mentioned here are mere ciphers
(see the Index of Persons for the best guess as to their identities), but
Marcus’s point does not depend on knowledge of the individuals.
10.33 as a cylinder rolls down: The comparison is taken from Chrysippus frg.
1000.
10.34 “. . . leaves that the wind . . .”: Homer, Iliad 6.147 ff., a very famous
passage.
11.3 [like the Christians]: This ungrammatical phrase is almost certainly a
marginal comment by a later reader; there is no reason to think Marcus
had the Christians in mind here. (See Introduction.)
11.6 “o Mount Cithaeron!”: Sophocles, Oedipus the King 1391 (Oedipus’s
anguished cry after blinding himself, invoking the mountain he was
abandoned on as a baby.)
“If I and my two children . . .”: See on 7.41.
“And why should we feel anger . . . ?”: See on 7.38.
“To harvest life . . .”: See on 7.40.
11.18 from Apollo: Often depicted as the leader of the nine Muses.
==>> Page 227
12.3 “a sphere rejoicing . . .”: Empedocles frg. B 27 (also quoted at 8.41).
12.11a What it’s made of: Part of 12 in the manuscripts; placed in 11 by Meric
Casaubon. Perhaps an incomplete entry, perhaps an addition by a later
hand.
12.17 Let your intention be < . . . >: The division between Chapters 17 and 18 is
unclear, and it seems likely that some text has been lost.
12.27 Fabius Catullinus et al.: Most of the references are obscure; see the
Index of Persons for what can be guessed of them.
12.34 people whose only morality . . . : The Epicureans.
==>> Page 228
Index of Persons
This list covers only persons named, referred to, or quoted in the text of the
Meditations itself.
GRIPPA: Roman general; adviser and close associate of AUGUSTUS, whose
daughter he married. (8.31)
LCIPHRON: Not certainly identified, although the context makes it clear that he
must be a contemporary of Marcus’s. He might be the Alciphron who
authored a surviving collection of imaginary letters from courtesans,
fishermen, etc., or a philosopher from Magnesia on the Maeander, quoted
twice by the third-century antiquarian Athenaeus. (10.31)
LEXANDER (1) “THE LITERARY CRITIC”: A Greek from Cotiaeum in Syria,
teacher of the great orator Aelius Aristides, as well as Marcus. (1.10)
LEXANDER (2) “THE PLATONIST”: A literary figure, mockingly dubbed
Alexander Peloplaton (“The Play-Doh Plato”) by his rivals. He served as
head of the Greek side of the imperial secretariat. (1.12)
LEXANDER (3) “THE GREAT”: (356–323 B.C.), ruler of Macedon (336–323)
who conquered much of the Near and Middle East before dying at the age of
thirty-three. His career was a favorite topic for moralizers and rhetoricians.
(3.3, 6.24, 8.3, 9.29, 10.27)
NTISTHENES: Follower of SOCRATES and forerunner of the Cynic school
(quoted 7.36).
NTONINUS: Titus Aurelius Antoninus Pius, Roman emperor (138–161). He
adopted Marcus in 138 at the age of sixteen (1.16, 1.17, 4.33, 6.30, 8.25, 9.21,
10.27). Marcus also refers to himself by this name (6.44).
POLLONIUS: Apollonius of Chalcedon, Stoic philosopher and one of Marcus’s
teachers. (1.8, 1.17)
==>> Page 229
marched on Rome in 49 B.C., precipitating a civil war against forces loyal to
POMPEY and the Senate. After the defeat of the Republican forces at the
battle of Pharsalia and the murder of Pompey he was made dictator for life,
but assassinated in 44 B.C. (3.3, 8.3)
AESO: Unknown, though obviously a figure from Republican history. (4.33)
AMILLUS: Marcus Furius Camillus, the (perhaps mythical) fourth-century B.C.
general who saved Rome when it was under attack by invading Gauls. (4.33)
ATO (1): Marcus Porcius Cato “the Elder,” consul and censor in the second
century B.C.; author of a surviving work on agriculture and a lost history. He
was an emblem of Roman moral rectitude and rough virtue. (4.33)
ATO (2): Marcus Porcius Cato “the Younger” (95–46 B.C.), great-grandson of
Cato (1), a senator and well-known Stoic in the late Republic. He fought on
the Republican side against Julius CAESAR and committed suicide after the
battle of Thapsus. He was immortalized in the poet Lucan’s epic The Civil
War, and became an emblem of Stoic resistance to tyranny. (1.14)
ATULUS: Cinna Catulus is named, along with MAXIMUS, as a Stoic mentor of
Marcus’s by the Historia Augusta, but nothing else is known of him. (1.13)
ECROPS: Legendary founder of Athens. (4.23)
ELER: Rhetorician who taught both Marcus and Lucius VERUS. (8.25)
HABRIAS: Evidently an associate of HADRIAN (2), like DIOTIMUS, but not
otherwise known. (8.37)
HARAX: Perhaps Charax of Pergamum, a historian known from other sources
to have been active in the second or third century. (8.25)
HRYSIPPUS: Stoic philosopher (280–207 B.C.), succeeded Zeno and Cleanthes
as leader of the school. His writings laid out the fundamental doctrines of
early Stoicism. (6.42, 7.19)
==>> Page 230
LOTHO: One of the three Fates of Greek mythology who are imagined as
spinning or weaving human fortunes. (4.34)
RATES: Cynic philosopher (c. 365–285 B.C.) and disciple of DIOGENES. (6.13)
RITO: Most likely the physician Titus Statilius Crito, active under Trajan.
(10.31)
ROESUS: Sixth-century king of Lydia, famous for his wealth and power until his
kingdom fell to the Persians. (10.27)
EMETER: Greek goddess of agriculture. (6.43)
EMETRIUS (1) OF PHALERUM: Fourth-century B.C. philosopher, student of
THEOPHRASTUS and governor of Athens under Macedonian rule. (9.29)
EMETRIUS (2) THE PLATONIST: Probably not Demetrius (1), who was an
adherent of the Peripatetic school, not a Platonist. A Cynic philosopher
banished by VESPASIAN has also been suggested, but the reference is more
likely to a contemporary figure now unknown. (8.25)
EMOCRITUS: Pre-Socratic philosopher (c. 460–370 B.C.) best known for
developing the theory of atoms later adopted by the Epicureans. (3.3; quoted
4.3, 4.24, 7.31a)
ENTATUS: Manius Curius Dentatus, third-century B.C. Roman general. (4.33)
IOGENES: Greek philosopher (c. 400–c. 325 B.C.) and founder of the Cynic
school, notable for his extreme ascetic lifestyle and contempt for social
conventions. (8.3, 11.6)
IOGNETUS: Marcus’s drawing teacher (according to the Historia Augusta),
though the entry suggests that he played a greater role in Marcus’s
development than this might suggest. (1.6)
ION: Sicilian aristocrat, a protégé of Plato, who saw in him a potential
philosopher-king. (1.14)
==>> Page 231
thanks in large part to his quotability and accessible style. (quoted 7.38, 7.40–
42, 7.50–51, 11.6)
UTYCHES: Unknown; the comparison with SATYRON does not help us identify
him. (10.31)
UTYCHION: Not certainly identified, unless the name is a slip for the
grammarian Eutychius Proculus. (10.31)
ABIUS: Unidentified, perhaps identical with FABIUS CATULLINUS. (4.50)
ABIUS CATULLINUS: Unknown. Perhaps to be identified with the FABIUS of
4.50. (12.27)
AUSTINA: Wife of ANTONINUS Pius (8.25). Marcus married their daughter,
also Faustina (1.17).
RONTO: Marcus Cornelius Fronto (c. 95–c. 166), rhetorician from Cirta in
North Africa, and a key figure in Marcus’s education. Portions of his letters
to Marcus survive in two palimpsest manuscripts discovered in the early
nineteenth century. (1.11)
ADRIAN (1): Prominent rhetorician; no relation to the emperor. (8.25)
ADRIAN (2): Roman emperor (117–138), best known for his travels and
cultural interests; adopted ANTONINUS as his heir on the condition that the
latter adopt Marcus and Lucius VERUS. (4.33, 8.5, 8.37, 10.27)
ELVIDIUS: Helvidius Priscus (died c. 75), son-in-law of THRASEA Paetus,
exiled and later executed for his opposition to the emperor VESPASIAN. (1.14)
ERACLITUS: Pre-Socratic philosopher (active c. 500 B.C.) from the city of
Ephesus, famous for his cryptic and paradoxical utterances. His exaltation of
the logos as a cosmic power and his identification of fire as the primal
substance were important influences on the Stoics (see also Introduction).
According to the third-century A.D. biographer Diogenes Laertius, he died of
dropsy, which he tried to cure by immersing himself in manure; this account
==>> Page 232
is almost certainly a later fiction. (3.3, 6.47, 8.3; quoted or paraphrased 4.46,
6.42)
IPPARCHUS: Second-century B.C. Greek astronomer. (6.47)
IPPOCRATES: Greek doctor active in the fifth century B.C.; various medical
writings are transmitted under his name, as is the Hippocratic Oath still
administered to doctors. (3.3)
YMEN: Unknown; the comparison with SATYRON does not help identify him.
(10.31)
ULIAN: This may be a friend of FRONTO’s, Claudius Julianus, a proconsul of
Asia at about this period. (4.50)
EPIDUS: This might perhaps be the Roman aristocrat who briefly shared power
with Marcus Antonius and the future emperor AUGUSTUS, but the context
suggests an older contemporary of Marcus’s. (4.50)
UCILLA: Marcus’s mother (d. 155/161). (1.3, 1.17, 8.25, 9.21)
USIUS LUPUS: Unknown. (12.27)
AECENAS: Adviser and unofficial minister of culture to AUGUSTUS; patron of
the poets Vergil and Horace, among others. (8.31)
ARCIANUS: Unknown philosopher. (1.6)
AXIMUS: Claudius Maximus. Roman consul in the early 140s. Governor of
Upper Pannonia in the early 150s. Later in that decade he governed North
Africa, where he served as judge in the trial of the novelist Apuleius for
sorcery. (1.15, 1.16, 1.17, 8.25)
ENIPPUS: Cynic philosopher (early third century B.C.) from Gadara in Syria.
He features as a character in many of the satirical dialogues of Lucian.
(6.47)
==>> Page 233
OMPEY: Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (106–48 B.C.), Roman politician and
general who rose to power in the 60s on the basis of a series of successful
campaigns in the East. His brief political alliance with Julius CAESAR gave
way to mutual rivalry and suspicion. When Caesar’s march on Rome
precipitated civil war in 49, Pompey led the senatorial resistance. Following
his defeat at the battle of Pharsalus, he fled to Egypt, where he was
murdered. (3.3, 8.3; family 8.31)
YTHAGORAS: Greek mathematician, philosopher, and mystic of the late sixth
century B.C. He founded a religious community in southern Italy whose
members were known especially for their devotion to music and geometry.
(6.47; compare 11.27)
USTICUS: Quintus Junius Rusticus, twice consul and city prefect of Rome in
the mid-160s. His influence on Marcus is attested by the Historia Augusta,
although the reference to him in 1.17 suggests that their relationship had its
ups and downs. (1.7, 1.17)
ATYRON: Unknown, though evidently a contemporary of Marcus. (10.31)
CIPIO: Either Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus (c. 235–183 B.C.), who
defeated Hannibal in the Second Punic War, or his grandson by adoption,
Publius Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus (185/4–129 B.C.), the conqueror of
Carthage in the Third Punic War. (4.33)
ECUNDA: Wife of MAXIMUS. (8.25)
EVERUS (1): Lucius Catilius Severus, Marcus’s great-grandfather. (1.4)
EVERUS (2): Gnaeus Claudius Severus Arabianus from Pompeiopolis in Asia
Minor, consul in 146; his son (perhaps the Severus of 10.31) married one of
Marcus’s daughters. He was an adherent of the Peripatetic school, which
traced its heritage back to Aristotle. (1.14)
EXTUS: Sextus of Chaeronea, Stoic philosopher, teacher of both Marcus and
Lucius VERUS, and nephew of the great biographer and antiquarian Plutarch.
(1.9)
==>> Page 234
ILVANUS: Perhaps Lamia Silvanus, a son-in-law of Marcus. (10.31)
OCRATES: Athenian philosopher (469–399 B.C.), teacher of PLATO. He spent
most of his life in his native city, and served with distinction in the
Peloponnesian War against Sparta. Although associated with several
members of the aristocratic junta that ruled Athens after its defeat in 404, he
refused to participate in their atrocities. He was executed by the Athenians
on a charge of impiety following the restoration of democracy; Plato’s
Apology purports to give his speech at the trial. (1.16, 3.3, 3.6, 6.47, 7.19,
7.66, 8.3, 11.23, 11.25, 11.28, 11.39)
OCRATICUS: Unknown; the comparison with SATYRON does not help identify
him. (10.31)
TERTINIUS: Not certainly identified. Tacitus mentions an army officer of this
name in the reign of Tiberius. But the reference to Baiae (a Roman resort on
the Bay of Naples) suggests a more likely candidate a generation or so later:
the wealthy Neapolitan physician Quintus Stertinius, mentioned by Pliny the
Elder (Natural History 29.7). (12.27)
ANDASIS: Philosopher mentioned along with one Marcianus; neither is
otherwise known. Some have suggested a scribe’s error for Basilides, listed
among Marcus’s teachers by other sources. (1.6)
ELAUGES: Apparently a lesser disciple of SOCRATES, unless the reference is to
the son of PYTHAGORAS by this name. (7.66)
HEODOTUS: Unknown, but he and BENEDICTA were most likely household
slaves. (1.17)
HEOPHRASTUS: Philosopher (c. 371–c. 287 B.C.) who succeeded Aristotle as
head of the Peripatetic school. (2.10)
HRASEA: Publius Clodius Thrasea Paetus (d. 66), Roman aristocrat (consul 56)
and father-in-law of HELVIDIUS Priscus. His opposition to the regime of
NERO (by whom he was eventually forced to commit suicide) was informed
by Stoic philosophy and in particular by the example of the younger CATO

mind is uncertain. (4.33)
ANTHIPPE: Wife of SOCRATES and proverbially a shrew. (11.28)
ENOCRATES: Platonic philosopher and head of the Academy at the end of the
fourth century B.C. (6.13)
ENOPHON: Probably a contemporary doctor mentioned by Galen. (10.31)
EUS: Sky god and head of the Greek pantheon; Marcus refers to him only
rarely and normally prefers a vaguer formulation such as “God” or “the
gods.” (4.23, 5.7, 5.8, 11.8)
